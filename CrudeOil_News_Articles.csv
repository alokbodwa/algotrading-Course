Venezuela Halts Oil Shipments To Europe Demands New Concessions.html,"The writing is on the wall for Europe in terms of this coming winter – It's going to get ugly.  With natural gas imports from Russia cut by 80% through Nord Stream 1 along with the majority of oil shipments, the EU is going to be scrambling for whatever fuel sources they can find to supply electricity and heating through the coming winter.  Two sources that were originally suggested as alternatives were Iran and Venezuela. Increased Iranian oil and gas exports to the west are highly dependent on the tentative nuclear deal, but as Goldman Sachs recently suggested, such a deal is unlikely anytime soon as deadlines on proposals have not been met and the Israeli government calls for negotiators to 'walk away.'  Venezuela had restarted shipments to Europe after 2 years of US sanctions under a deal that allows them to trade oil for debt relief.  However, the country's government has now suspended those shipments, saying it is no longer interested in oil-for-debt deals and instead wants refined fuels from Italian and Spanish producers in exchange for crude.
 This might seem like a backward exchange but Venezuela's own refineries are struggling to remain in operation because of a lack of investment and lack of repairs.  Refined fuels would help them to get back on their feet in terms of energy and industry.  Some of Venezuela's own heavy oil operations require imported diluents in order to continue.  The EU says it currently has no plans to lift restrictions on the oil-for-debt arrangement, which means Europe has now lost yet another energy source. Related: Wall Street Sees Another Big Commodities Rally In 2022 Sanctions on Venezuela along with declining investments have strangled their oil industry, with overall production dropping by 38% this July compared to a year ago.  Joe Biden's initial moves to reopen talks with Maduro triggered inflated hopes that Venezuelan oil would flow once again and offset tight global markets and rising prices.  Europe in particular will soon be desperate for energy alternatives, which will probably result in scouring of markets this autumn to meet the bare minimum requirements for heating.
 If this occurs and no regular sources of energy can be found to fill the void left by Russian sanctions, prices will rise precipitously in the EU.  Not only that but with European countries buying up energy supplies wherever they can find them, available sources will also shrink for every other nation including the US.  Get ready for oil and energy prices to spike once again as winter's chill returns.  ",N
Middle East Producers Expect To Bank Additional 13 Trillion From Oil Exports.html,"The major oil exporting countries in the Middle East are expected to receive an additional $1.3 trillion from oil by 2026, thanks to high oil prices and the global oil market turmoil after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The Gulf states in particular are set for “additional cumulative oil revenues of $1.3tn through 2026,” Jihad Azour, IMF director for the Middle East and North Africa, told the Financial Times this week. According to IMF experts, the oil revenue bonanza will bolster the coffers of the large sovereign wealth funds of the major exporters in the Middle East and prop up the monarchies in those states.
 However, Azour cautioned that the Gulf oil and gas exporters should use the windfall to invest in the future, including in preparation for the energy transition. Unlike the U.S. and many economies in Europe, which see slowing growth and could tip into recession as soon as the winter comes, the economy of the largest oil exporter in the Middle East and the world, Saudi Arabia, is set for one of the fastest growth rates this year with the jump in oil prices and higher oil production, the IMF said earlier this week. “Saudi Arabia is likely to be one of the world’s fastest-growing economies this year as sweeping pro-business reforms and a sharp rise in oil prices and production power recovery from a pandemic-induced recession in 2020. Gross domestic product is expected to expand by 7.6 percent, the fastest growth in almost a decade,” the IMF said.
 “Managing oil revenues in a sustainable manner, so that spending does not rise and fall in line with the price of oil, would promote fiscal sustainability and prevent a return to previous oil-driven cycles of boom and bust. So too would far-sighted budget planning and policies to diversify the economy,” the IMF noted.",N
OPEC Sees Robust Oil Demand Despite Sell Off.html,"Global oil demand is still robust and will be such through the end of this year, OPEC Secretary General Haitham al-Ghais told Reuters, noting that the recent sell-off in oil doesn't reflect fundamentals and is driven by fear. ""We still feel very bullish on demand and very optimistic on demand for the rest of this year,"" al-Ghais told Reuters in an interview published on Thursday.    Oil prices dropped earlier this month to their lowest level in six months, to the level just before the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The move lower was driven by fears of recession and concerns about the health of the Chinese economy and was further exacerbated by thin trading volumes as traders and speculators are either on vacation or not trading oil amid heightened volatility.  OPEC, however, sees robust demand, according to its new secretary general.
 ""There is a lot of speculation and anxiety, and that's what's predominantly driving the drop in prices,"" al-Ghais told Reuters. ""Whereas in the physical market we see things much differently. Demand is still robust,"" OPEC's chief added.  Fears of a major Chinese economic slowdown are overblown, according to al-Ghais. OPEC did revise down last week its global oil demand growth estimate for this year by 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) but said in its closely-watched Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) it still expects ""healthy growth"".
 OPEC sees world oil demand growing by 3.1 million bpd this year, down by 260,000 bpd from last month's growth assessment of 3.36 million bpd growth. Demand is still expected to show ""healthy growth of 3.1 mb/d, including the recently observed trend of burning more crude in power generation,"" OPEC said. This year, total oil demand is expected to average around 100 million bpd. OPEC left its 2023 demand growth estimate unchanged from the previous report at 2.7 million bpd, with total 2023 oil demand expected to reach 102.72 million bpd. ""In 2023, expectations for healthy global economic growth, combined with expected improvements in the containment of COVID-19 in China, are expected to boost consumption of oil,"" OPEC said last week.     ",N
Goldman Sachs Less Positive About Chinas Economic Growth.html,"Goldman Sachs has revised its forecast for China’s economic growth from 3.3 percent to 3 percent for this year. The bank attributed the revision to weaker than expected data for July and a tight energy supply. Bloomberg noted in a report on the news that the July data showed a deepening housing crisis combined with continued Covid restrictions, topped by a recent unexpected decision by the central bank of the country to cut interest rates. Slower economic growth for the world’s powerhouse would mean a softening in oil prices, which would be very welcome by other large consumers who have been trying for months to bring prices down with limited success.
 Indeed, Brent crude and WTI have been trading below $100 for more than a week now, amid thickening clouds over global economic growth. There have been a number of reasons for this but economic data suggesting a slowdown in China has been among the bigger ones. China also reported weaker refinery runs and imports for July, even though it continued building its oil inventories. Goldman is not the only one getting increasingly pessimistic about China’s growth prospects, either. Per the Bloomberg report, Nomura also revised its forecast for the country’s GDP, a lot more substantially than Goldman, reducing it from 3.3 percent to 2.8 percent.
 “Beijing will likely do more to arrest the slowdown, but rolling out a comprehensive stimulus package is of low probability in a year of government reshuffle, while the need for maintaining zero Covid makes conventional stimulus measures much less effective,” the bank’s economists wrote in a note. Dutch ING Groep and Canada’s TD Securities also revised down their economic outlook for China in the last few days, signaling that pessimism is spreading across the analyst community as China continues battling Covid flare-ups following its zero-Covid policy and a housing downturn with developers defaulting on bond payments and struggling to complete paid-for apartments.",N
Saudi Aramco Is Taking A Page Out Of The US Shale Playbook.html,"Saudi Aramco, (ARMCO) reported Q-2, 2022 earnings this week and set tongues wagging with the sheer amount of cash being generated in its daily operations. Net income of $48.4 bn, Free Cash Flow of $34.6 bn for the quarter, and $65 bn for the first half, substantially eclipsed year-ago numbers of $22.6 bn and $40.9 bn for the same period. All of this was driven by price realizations for crude topping the $113.00/bbl mark for the quarter, exceeding year-ago prices ($67.90) by ~66%. What was noteworthy, and documented in a recent Wall Street Journal article, was the company’s capital allocation budget toward increasing production remained largely unchanged at the lower end of its previously announced range of $40-50 bn for 2022. The Journal article went on to note- “To be fair, $40 billion is a lot, much more than in 2021, but Aramco is very flush. It earned more than $65 billion in free cash flow in the first half of this year. That spending also includes diversifying into natural gas, wind, solar and blue hydrogen. And while capital discipline is laudable, surely if management really believes that oil demand is growing for the next decade, it should at the very least accelerate plans to expand its maximum sustainable oil capacity to 13.0 million barrels a day, currently set for 2027.” Where the Saudi mindset appears to depart from their oil-producing cousins on the other side of the planet, is what is to be done with the excess cash now being realized. While U.S. shale producers are raining wealth on their shareholders, in the form of stock buybacks and special dividends, KSA-94% owner of ARAMCO, has focused on paying down debt, and diversifying its energy portfolio. In some ways mimicking the actions of the mega oil producers like ExxonMobil, (NYSE:XOM) Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP), by delving into alternative energy forms.  The supermajors, tired of being clubbed by the climate alarmists, and having totally bought into the Paris Accord Net Zero by 2030 dictums, have been diverting capital away from legacy sources and toward cleaner energy forms that raise their ESG scores. Author of, The End of Fossil Fuel Insanity, Terry Etam, summarized their plight in an article carried in the BOE Report discussing the coming gap between supply and demand- “There is little producers can do to help out. Their ‘inventory’ – oil and gas reserves – is in incredibly high demand, and is being bid up in price. What would help alleviate this situation is to find and develop more reserves, but the world’s cultural elite, the group that dominates western political schools of thought, has ‘scientifically’ linked any weather event – anything at all – with climate change, which is linked to ‘fossil fuel combustion', which is therefore bad, and the mere suggestion of increasing production is unacceptable.”
 In this regard, the supermajors have been “Greenwashing” their portfolios in some cases and beginning to transition them in others. Here they depart from the Saudis who intend to straddle the gap between petroleum and green energy into the foreseeable future. In spite of a publically asserted view by Aramco CEO, Amin Nasser that oil demand will grow for the rest of this decade, KSA appears to be in no hurry to accelerate the timetable for achieving the 13 mm BOPD upper threshold set for 2027. Instead, KSA has embarked on an ambitious decade-long quest to diversify its economy away from its sole reliance on oil and gas, choosing a multi-pronged approach that includes hydrogen, wind, and solar.  One area where they are focusing their efforts is in the production of hydrogen-H2. A Financial Times-FT article notes that the Saudis plan to dominate the production of H2, a few years hence. With its abundant supplies of gas nearby the City of Neom, a Blue-H2 plant is being built with $110 bn of capital. This plant is planned to take 2.2 bn cubic feet of gas daily from the supergiant Jafurrah gas field, for processing Blue H2. It is forecast to come on line in 2026. Another massive hydrogen project will produce Green H-2, with power supplied by a 99-turbine wind farm. SP Global discusses this in an article focusing on Acwa Power’s 240K mt/ton per year, green hydrogen project that will make 1.2 mm MT of ammonia. It also is expected to start production in 2026. Finally, solar is thought to have unlimited potential in the Kingdom. It makes sense as the sun shines brightly there more than 300 days per year. Accordingly, KSA is fielding a number of new solar farm projects getting underway. The sovereign wealth fund of the Kingdom just this year let two awards for a total of 1 GW IPP One went to Acwa Power for a 700 MW farm at Al-Rass and a second smaller, 300 MW farm at Saad. The Kingdom has a goal of installing 54 GW of solar generation by 2030. Solar is also finding industrial uses as the Glass Point complex takes shape. This 1.5 GW project, the biggest solar farm in the world will power an aluminum smelting plant designed to use the solar mirrors on water-filled pipes to produce solar steam. This will save approximately 600K tons of carbon annually. 
 Your takeaway It is fairly clear from the decisions that KSA is making about the capital allocation for renewable forms of energy that their feet are firmly planted in both camps. The higher price regime that has settled on the oil market since 2021 has provided the cash to fund the projects we have discussed, that will fuel the Saudi Vision 2030 initiative. At the same time, like their shale counterparts in the U.S., they are committed to an orderly development of their legacy oil reserves in a way that will preserve value as far into the future as possible. That’s just good stewardship. What this means is that in spite of entreaties by world leaders including the American president to produce more oil to lower prices, oil producers in the U.S. and in Saudi Arabia are seemingly determined to hold the line on capital spending. This will have the effect of keeping supplies tight and prices higher than they otherwise would be.",N
Energy Sanctions On Russia Have Been A Boon For China And India.html,"When the UK and the U.S. banned Russian oil imports, and the European Union approved sanctions that made it a lot harder to trade in Russian oil, media reports highlighted the argument that Russian could not possibly replace Europe with Asia as its biggest oil client. What wasn’t so widely reported on was China and India’s dependence on imported oil, any imported oil compatible with their refinery setups, and how important prices were for both, given their size and import dependence. And both countries certainly took advantage of Western sanctions. Russian crude has been trading at a discount to global benchmarks since March. This discount has been a boon for buyers in China and India. The Wall Street Journal recently reported, for example, that China’s Sinopec posted strong financial figures for its first quarter, at least in part thanks to cheap Russian oil. Meanwhile, Russia became China’s largest oil supplier earlier this year, according to Chinese customs data for May, overtaking its OPEC+ partner Saudi Arabia. It also overtook Saudi in India because of the discount at which Russian crude now sells. Speaking of that discount, it has been shrinking in the past few weeks, suggesting that demand from China and India has been strong enough to keep Russian oil flowing abroad in large enough volumes to keep the oil revenue flowing back into Russia.
 Bloomberg reported last week that there was a dip in these oil flows in the week to August 12, with the total amount of Russian oil sent to Asian buyers falling to the lowest since March, after plateauing at around 2 million bpd between April and June, the report noted. Even so, the discount of ESPO crude sold to Asia, which was as deep as $20 per barrel in March, has vanished, with at least two cargos set to load next month and in September selling at parity with the Dubai benchmark, per a Reuters report. The shrinking of the discount of Russian oil could be one reason for the decline in volumes going to Asia. Another could be that the stocking up on cheap crude from Russia has been going well both in India and China. Reuters’ Clyde Russell suggested in a recent column that this redirection of Russian oil flows makes Russia “increasingly reliant on just two countries when it comes to selling its crude oil.” India and China now account for more than 40 percent of Russian exports, he noted, up from half that a year ago. The thing is that this reliance is mutual. The big Asian powerhouses need cheap energy to remain big Asian powerhouses. China has been Russia’s biggest oil buyer for years. And Russia needs new markets for its crude, especially after the EU embargo comes into effect at the end of this year. 
 Once this embargo comes into effect, global oil prices, bar an Iran nuclear deal, will jump sharply. And China and India, along with smaller buyers such as Turkey, Egypt, and even troubled Sri Lanka, will be the winners, keeping their access to Russian crude at preferential prices. The WSJ report noted that if an oil buyers’ cartel comes into existence, it would also benefit Chinese and Indian oil buyers as neither country has joined G7’s initiative for this cartel. It may be a good thing that the chances of such a cartel materializing are quite slim. No wonder the International Energy Agency said earlier this month Western sanctions had had a limited effect on Russian oil production, noting that in July, Russian crude output was only 310,000 bpd below its levels before the Ukraine invasion. It also revised upwards its forecast for production next year.",N
Oil Jumps On Massive Crude Inventory Draw.html,"Crude oil prices moved higher today, after the Energy Information Administration estimated a draw in oil inventories of 7.1 million barrels for the week to August 12. This compared with a build of 5.5 million barrels reported for the previous week. A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute estimated a modest crude draw of 448,000 barrels for the week to August 12. In gasoline, the EIA estimated an inventory draw of 4.6 million barrels for last week, which compared with a 5-million-barrel decline for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 10 million bpd last week, which compared with 10.2 million bpd during the previous week.
 In middle distillates, the EIA reported an inventory build of 800,000 barrels, which compared with a much needed build of 2.2 million barrels for the previous week as inventories have fallen to critical levels. Middle distillate production averaged 5.1 million barrels daily, compared with 5.1 million bpd for the previous week. Oil prices hit the lowest in six months earlier this week but recovered after the API report as it suggested demand for oil remained stable despite the challenging economic situation. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $92.47 per barrel, with West Texas Intermediate changing hands for $87.01 per barrel.
 ""A drawdown of U.S. gasoline stockpiles for a second straight week has reassured investors that demand is resilient, prompting buys,"" one oil analyst from Fujitomi Securities told Reuters this week. ""Still, the oil market is expected to stay under pressure, with fairly high volatility, due to worries over a potential global recession,"" Kazuhiko Saito added. The volatility is being fed also by continued uncertainty about the Iran nuclear deal, after Iran sent a written response to the EU’s latest proposal with Iranian media suggesting it won’t accept it as is. Another factor fuelling price volatility are the latest oil demand figures from China, which were weaker than many expected.",N
US Crude Inventories Fell To Lowest Level Since 2004 In June.html,"Crude oil inventories in the United States dropped by 21.8 million barrels to 915.8 million barrels in June, which was the lowest level since 2004, the latest data from the Joint Organisations Data Initiative (JODI) showed on Wednesday. Product inventories, on the other hand, rose by 34.1 million barrels to 650.5 million barrels, according to the data from JODI, which compiles self-reported data from countries.   The low crude inventory levels in the United States in June coincided with the latest rally in oil prices in the early days of the month when the EU announced an embargo on imports of seaborne Russian crude and petroleum products, to enter in full force in early 2023.
 In the second week of June, U.S. gasoline prices jumped to exceed a national average of $5 per gallon, a record high. The $5 threshold had been widely expected for weeks, considering the rise in international crude oil prices, the constrained refinery capacity in the United States, the robust demand despite record-high prices, and multi-year low fuel inventories in the U.S.    After the middle of June, however, fears on the global markets of a recession in many countries resulted in several heavy sell-offs in oil, and oil prices have dropped to below $100 per barrel. As a result of declining international crude prices, the average U.S. gasoline price dropped last week to below $4 per gallon for the first time since early March, as supply has risen and concerns about the economy have grown. As of August 17, the national average was $3.943 per gallon, down from $4.532/gal a month ago, but still higher compared to the year-ago average of $3.183 per gallon, per AAA data.
 In U.S. oil stocks, the latest industry data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed on Tuesday a draw for crude oil of 448,000 barrels, while analysts predicted a smaller draw of 117,000 barrels. The API also reported a draw in gasoline inventories of 4.480 million barrels for the week ending August 12, compared to the previous week’s 627,000-barrel draw. U.S. crude inventories have shed some 61 million barrels since the start of 2021, with a 1.7 million barrel gain since the start of 2020, according to API data.  ",N
Are Iraqs Ambitious Oil Production Goals Feasible.html,"  Iraq is planning to increase its crude oil production to phased targets of 5 to 8 million barrels per day (bpd) over time, according to the first vice president of the Iraq National Oil Company (INOC), Hamid Younis, last week. The director general of the Iraq Oil Exploration Company (IOEC), Ali Jassim, added that the next phase will see “remarkable activity” in the exploration sector, including operations in the Western Desert and the Nineveh governorate. Given the current delicate supply-demand balance in the global oil pricing matrix, sizeable new supply would go some way to relieving the economic damage being done to many countries by enduring high oil and gas prices, but just how realistic are these statements on higher oil volumes from Iraq? In broad terms, the statements are entirely realistic, with Iraq holding a very conservatively estimated 145 billion barrels of proven crude oil reserves (nearly 18 percent of the Middle East’s total, around 9 percent of the globe’s, and the fifth largest in the world). However, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its 2012 report on the country, the extent of Iraq’s ultimately recoverable oil resources is subject to a large degree of uncertainty and may well turn out to be a lot more. Much of the earlier data that fed into the 145 billion barrels reserves figure was derived from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) 2000 assessment and, using this data, the IEA’s 2012 analysis put the level of ultimately recoverable crude and natural gas liquids resources in Iraq at around 232 billion barrels. As at the end of 2011, only 35 billion barrels of that 232 billion figure had been produced.  Having said this, as the IEA itself pointed out, there are other estimates from reliable sources that Iraq’s undiscovered oil resources are considerably higher even than the IEA’s figures. When Iraq’s Ministry of Oil came up with its own crude oil reserves figure of 143 billion barrels in 2010 – before it was upgraded to 145 billion barrels two years later – the Ministry stated that Iraq’s undiscovered resources amounted to around 215 billion barrels. Moreover, said the IEA, a detailed study by Petrolog, published in 1997, reached a similar figure but even this did not include within this 215-billion-barrel figure, crude oil resources in the parts of northern Iraq under the administration of the government of the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan (the KRG).
 Back in 2012, and even using the more conservative USGS figure, Iraq had produced only 15 percent of its ultimately recoverable resources, compared with 23 percent for the Middle East as a whole, according to the IEA, and the Agency expected exploration efforts to add substantially to proven reserves in the future. Moreover, drilling in Iraq has long had an exceptionally high success rate: of 530 potential hydrocarbon-bearing geological prospects identified by geophysical means in Iraq as of the time of the 2012 IEA report, only 113 had been drilled, with oil having been found in 73 of them. The IEA also noted that prior to the then-recent surge in exploration activity in the KRG area, more than half of the exploratory wells in Iraq had been drilled prior to 1962, a time when technical limits and a low oil price gave a much tighter definition of a commercially successful well than would be the case today. It is apposite to note at this point, however, that it is one thing to have huge levels of reserves and recoverable resources, but it is quite another to drill them and export them, and over the period from when the IEA report was produced in 2012 to now, crude oil production in Iraq has risen from just over 3 million bpd to just over 4 million bpd only. It could be said that this is an impressive 25 percent rise, but in absolute terms, it ranks as an extremely poor return on the crude oil resources that Iraq has, particularly when factoring in how easy its oil is to recover, as evidenced by the country’s crude oil having the lowest lifting cost in the world of US$1-2 per barrel, alongside the crude oil of Saudi Arabia and Iran.  In contrast to actual oil production figures, in 2013 Iraq launched its ‘Integrated National Energy Strategy’ (INES), which formulated the three forward oil production profiles for Iraq, as analyzed in depth in my latest book on the global oil markets. The INES’ best-case scenario was for crude oil production capacity to increase to 13 million bpd (at that point by 2017), peaking at around that level until 2023, and finally gradually declining to around 10 million bpd over a long period thereafter. The mid-range production scenario was for Iraq to reach 9 million bpd (at that point by 2020), and the worst-case INES scenario was for production to reach 6 million bpd (at that point by 2020). These different crude oil output trajectories were also in line with those laid out in the IEA’s 2012 report. Specifically, in the IEA’s ‘Central Scenario’ of 2012, Iraq’s oil production increased to more than 6 million bpd (by 2020), and then 8.3 million bpd by 2035. In the IEA’s ‘High Case’, crude oil production would surpass 9 million bpd in 2020 and then rise to 10.5 million bpd in 2035. 
  Related: Cotton Prices Soar As Texas Megadrought Persists The foundation for Iraq to achieve these massive increases in crude oil production is, therefore, absolutely solid. So, why has it not done so yet? There are two basic reasons for this, both of which – and other tangential reasons - are analyzed in full in my latest book: the first being the endemic corruption that has plagued the Iraq oil sector, particularly since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, and the second – in part, a function of the first reason but not completely – is the failure to build the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP). The culture of corruption in Iraq has been covered in many of my previous articles but has also been repeatedly attested to by the independent Transparency International (TI) in various of its ‘Corruption Perceptions Index’ publications, in which Iraq normally features in the worst 10 out of 180 countries for its scale and scope of corruption. “Massive embezzlement, procurement scams, money laundering, oil smuggling and widespread bureaucratic bribery that have led the country to the bottom of international corruption rankings, fuelled political violence and hampered effective state-building and service delivery,” TI states. “Political interference in anti-corruption bodies and politicization of corruption issues, weak civil society, insecurity, lack of resources and incomplete legal provisions severely limit the government’s capacity to efficiently curb soaring corruption,” it concludes.  This may be a key reason why the CSSP has not gone ahead, but if Iraq could ringfence the Project as much as possible from corrupt elements then it could start to achieve the huge increases in crude oil production that it envisages. The CSSP itself involves taking seawater from the Persian Gulf and then treating it before transporting it via pipelines to oil fields to boost pressure and increase oil take. Initially, the CSSP was to have cost around US$10 billion for it to be able to supply around 6 million bpd of water to at least five oil fields in the southern Basra area and one in the Maysan region. To put the risk-reward profile of the CSSP in context: the longstanding huge fields of Kirkuk and Rumaila – together having produced around 80 percent of Iraq’s cumulative oil production – require major ongoing water injection, with reservoir pressure at the former dropping significantly after the output of only around 5 percent of the oil in place (OIP). Another huge Iraq oilfield – Rumaila – was able to produce around 25 percent of its OIP before water injection was required because its main reservoir formation in the south connects to a large natural aquifer which has helped to push the oil out of the reservoir. The water requirements for most of Iraq’s oilfields fall between these two cases, but the need for oilfield water injection is highest in southern Iraq, in which water resources are also the least available.

Gas To Oil Switch May Not Be A Huge Catalyst For EU Crude Demand.html,"Last week, oil prices finished the week in the green, gaining 3.5% after tumbling nearly 10% a week earlier thanks to a weakening dollar after better-than-expected inflation data altered interest rate expectations from the Fed. Unfortunately, the oil price rally has been snuffed out in a dramatic fashion. WTI and Brent crude have both declined more than 5% in Monday’s morning session to trade at $87.31/bbl and 93.16/bbl on demand fears as disappointing Chinese economic data renewed global recession concerns. China's central bank cut key lending rates in a bid to revive demand as the latest data showed the economy unexpectedly slowing in July–and the market wasn’t expecting it.  China’s industrial output grew 3.8% in July from a year earlier, well below the 4.6% consensus on Wall Street. The grim set of figures is an indication that the world’s largest importer of crude is struggling to shake off the effects of Beijing’s Covid restrictions months earlier. Coupled with high oil price volatility, this is taking a heavy toll on oil prices, with Brent crude open interest this month down 20% compared to a year ago levels. ""Open interest is still falling, with some (market players) not interested in touching it because of volatility. That is, in my view, the reason resulting in higher volumes to the downside,"" UBS oil analyst Giovanni Staunovo has said, adding that the trigger for Monday’s drop was weak Chinese data. But a slowing Chinese economy might be just one of a host of bearish catalysts that might conspire to keep oil prices grounded if Europe’s natural gas stockpiles are any indication. Gas to Oil Switching
 Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, dozens of Eurozone countries pledged to heavily cut Russian natural gas imports or halt them completely as soon as they can afford to. These countries took several aggressive measures to replenish their natural gas stockpiles ahead of the winter season, including  reaching a political agreement to cut gas use by 15% through next winter. And now there's a growing sense that Europe might not only meet its gas targets but also exceed them. European governments had been worried that Russia's cut in supplies through its main gas pipeline to Germany would leave many of them with less than sufficient supplies for the winter season. However, many European nations have managed to build up ample gas storage by switching from gas to coal for some power plants, steadily curbing gas demand, and increasing imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). According to a report by the Observer Research Foundation, energy supply disruptions triggered by Russia’s war on Ukraine took LNG prices even higher leaving coal as the only option for dispatchable and affordable power in much of Europe, including the tough markets of Western Europe and North America that have explicit policies to phase out coal. Coal mines and power plants that closed shop 10 years ago have begun to be repaired in Germany. Now, Germany looks set to burn at least 100,000 tons of coal per month by winter. That’s a big U-turn considering that Germany's goal had been to phase out all coal-generated electricity by 2038. Nor is Germany alone: Austria, Poland, the Netherlands and Greece are also gearing up for coal plant restarts, while China’s coal imports have been surging, increasing 24% month-to-month in July as power generators increased purchases to provide for peak summer electricity demand. China has the largest number of operational coal power plants with 3,037 while Germany, the largest economy in the EU has 63.  Related: BP To Sell Mexican Oil Assets As It Ramps Up Renewable Business
 As a result, thermal coal, which is the variety used to generate power, has seen a 170% rise in price since the end of 2021--most of those gains made following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  Ramped-up LNG imports have also helped, with the EU importing 21.36 million tonnes of LNG in the first half of 2022, up from just 8.21 million tonnes during last year’s comparable period. In a historical precedent, Europe is now taking in more American LNG than piped Russian gas. The result: injections to Europe’s gas storage are running about nine weeks ahead of last year, an impressive feat even after flows from Russia have been severely curtailed. European gas storage levels are above 70%, and have even surpassed the 5-year average, according to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE).  By November 1st, the EU will likely hit 80% natural gas storage capacity–just in time for peak winter demand. Germany is even aiming for 95% capacity, and is already at 75%.  This is set to curb oil demand since some operators have begun switching from gas to oil generation due to high natural gas prices.  ""The EU already surpassed its September 1 interim filling target in early July and is still on pace to reach the November 1 target,"" Jacob Mandel, senior associate for commodities at Aurora Energy Research, has told Reuters. Indeed, analysts at Standard Chartered Plc are saying that President Vladimir Putin’s gas weapon will be effectively blunted by the inventory build, with Europe set to go through winter “comfortably” without Russian gas. More than enough natural gas available will, unfortunately, lower oil demand as an alternative. That said, Europe will have to pay a heavy price: the cost of replenishing natural gas stocks is estimated at over 50 billion euros ($51 billion), 10 times more than the historical average for filling up tanks ahead of winter.",N
US Shale Faces More Than 10 Billion In Hedging Losses.html,"U.S. shale oil producers are in line to suffer more than $10 billion in derivative hedging losses this year if oil prices remain around $100 per barrel, Rystad Energy research shows. Many shale operators offset their risk exposure through derivative hedging, helping them to raise capital for operations more efficiently. Those who hedged at lower prices last year are in line to suffer significant associated losses as their contracts mean they cannot capitalize on sky-high prices. Despite these hedging losses, record-high cash flow and net income have been widely reported by US onshore exploration and production (E&P) companies this earnings season. These operators are now adapting their strategies and negotiating contracts for the second half of 2022 and 2023 based on current high prices, so if oil prices fall next year, these agile E&Ps will be able to capitalize and will likely boast even stronger financials. Anticipating the significant negative impact of these hedges, shale operators made a concerted effort in the first half of this year to lower their exposure and limit the impact on their balance sheets. Many operators have successfully negotiated higher ceilings for 2023 contracts and based on current reported hedging activity for next year, even at a crude price of $100 per barrel, losses would total just $3 billion, a significant drop from this year. At $85 per barrel, hedged losses would total $1.5 billion; if it fell further to $65, hedging activity would be a net earner for operators. E&Ps typically employ derivative hedging to limit cash flow risks and secure funding for operations. However, commodity derivative hedging is not the only risk management strategy operators use. Rystad Energy’s analysis looked at a peer group of 28 US light tight oil (LTO) producers, whose collective guided 2022 oil production accounts for close to 40% of the expected US shale total. Of this group, 21 operators have detailed their 2022 hedging positions as of August. The group includes all public hedging activity in the sector as supermajors do not employ derivative hedging as a funding strategy, and private operators do not disclose their hedges publicly.
 “With huge losses on the table, operators have been frantically adapting their hedging strategies to minimize losses this year and next. As a result, we may not have seen peak cash flow in the industry yet, which is hard to believe given the soaring financials reported in recent weeks,” says Rystad Energy vice president Alisa Lukash.  Operators currently have 42% of their total guided and estimated oil output for 2022 hedged at a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) average floor of $55 per barrel. Overall, producers have hedged 46% of their expected crude oil output for the year. In the second quarter, companies reported an average negative hedging impact of $21 per barrel on their realized crude prices – the value they receive for production minus any negative hedging impact. For some operators like Chesapeake Energy and Laredo Petroleum, the impact has been higher, at above $35 per barrel. Fewer companies reported any significant effect on their derivatives contracts in the latest quarter compared to the previous three months. Still, an analysis of the difference in the hedging impact on realized prices per operator between the first and the second quarter shows that in most cases, second-quarter losses were stronger by $4 per barrel on average. 
 The U.S. onshore oil and gas industry’s hedging strategy has been closely tracked as a critical barometer for cash flows, particularly given the sharp price volatility over the past few years, allowing investors and lenders to make funding calls. Operators have already increased the cover for their expected oil volumes in 2023 to 17%, with many targeting 20% to 40% of output to be secured with derivatives. Significantly, 2023 contracts would limit hedging losses at $100 per barrel WTI to only $3 billion compared to $10.2 billion in 2022.    The analysis includes all contracts, with full or partial floor protection: swaps, collars and three-way collars. Collected contracts reference different price strips: WTI Nymex, WTI Midland, WTI Houston and Brent. We have converted everything to a Nymex WTI equivalent, assuming a spread of $0.30 per barrel for WTI Midland, $0.70 for WTI Houston and $2.50 for Brent.",N
Aramco Stands Ready To Boost Oil Output To 12 Million Bpd.html,"Aramco is ready to ramp up oil production to 12 million bpd whenever the Saudi government asks this of the company, CEO Amin Nasser said this weekend, as quoted by Arab News. Speaking at the presentation of Aramco's second-quarter and first-half results, Nasser noted that global oil demand is exhibiting healthy growth, and more would be coming from Asia. At the same time, the executive said he was worried about declining production rates at mature fields and the lack of investment in new oil exploration on a global scale.
 In that, the Aramco chief executive echoed the concern of Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman, who has repeatedly said that low investments in new oil production are the basis of higher oil prices. Indeed, Aramco's Nasser said that next year could see 2 million bpd in additional global growth with no spare capacity to meet this higher demand. In its latest Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC forecast global oil demand growth at 3.1 million bpd this year, set to decline to 2.7 million bpd in 2023, with the total rising from about 100 million bpd in 2022 to 102.7 million bpd in 2023.
 Saudi Arabia is the OPEC member with the greatest spare capacity, at least on paper, and Aramco earlier this year announced plans to boost what it calls Maximum Sustainable Capacity from the current level of 12 million bpd to 13 million bpd by 2027. At the same time, the Saudis will not rush into production ramp-ups in anticipation of tighter oil markets. According to unnamed sources cited by Reuters earlier this month, Saudi Arabia and the UAE could increase their oil output significantly but would only do it if oil supply really tightened. ""With possibly no gas in Europe this winter, with a potential price cap on Russian oil sales in the New Year, we can't be throwing every barrel on the market at the moment,"" one of the sources explained.",N
Colombias New Leftwing President Is Hiking Taxes On Its Oil Industry.html,"After an electoral victory, which shocked many in and outside of Colombia, long-time senator and former leftist guerilla Gustavo Petro was inaugurated as Colombia’s President last Sunday. The once controversial mayor of the capital Bogota campaigned on a platform of ending extractive industries in the Andean country, including banning hydraulic fracturing and ceasing the award of new licenses for oil exploration. That triggered considerable consternation among many analysts, industry insiders and economists because of Colombia’s tremendous economic dependence on petroleum production and exports. Crude oil is the strife-torn country’s key legal export generating for the first six months of 2022 $10.3 billion which is 36% of total export earnings for the period. That was followed by $5.3 billion in export earnings from coal and in third place coffee which generated $2.3 billion. Petroleum is responsible for around 3% of Colombia’s gross domestic product and a fifth of Bogota’s fiscal income. That makes Colombia’s oil industry a key component of its economy and driver of the post-pandemic recovery, particularly especially with prices having rallied sharply since the end of 2021. The international benchmark Brent has soared roughly 44% for the year to date to be trading at around $97 per barrel giving earnings for Colombia’s oil industry a significant boost. That will see Bogota’s fiscal revenue surge, especially if national oil company Ecopetrol, which is 88.5% owned by Colombia’s government, hikes its dividend, or makes a one-off special payment to investors. The economic recovery now underway in Colombia and the growing contribution of the petroleum industry, because of significantly higher prices, to the strife-torn country’s post-pandemic recovery couldn’t occur at a more crucial time. The Andean country’s economy suffered extensively under the administration of Petro’s predecessor Ivan Duque with violence, poverty, and unemployment spiking, particularly because of the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. That coupled with an ever-deeper budget deficit and inability to successfully reform tax collection is placing considerable financial pressure on Bogota and Colombia’s sovereign credit rating. In May 2021, after being rocked by violent protests against Duque’s proposed tax reforms, Colombia’s sovereign debt rating was downgraded from investment grade to junk status. International rating agency S&P Global Ratings dropped the rating from an investment grade BB+ to a speculative setting at BBB- with a stable outlook. Other rating agencies took similar measures, Fitch reduced Colombia’s credit rating to BB+ during July 2021 and Moody’s to Baa2 in October that year. It is Colombia’s ballooning budget deficit and weak government finances which are weighing heavily on the sovereign debt rating as well as fiscal outlook. At the height of the pandemic, during 2020, Bogota recorded a budget deficit that was 7.8% of GDP, which since the economy reopened from one of the world’s longest coronavirus lockdowns fell to 7.1% for 2021. While record spending is proposed for 2022 with Colombia’s congress approving a $93 billion budget the annual deficit is expected to only be 7% of GDP, marking another decline since 2020. That notable spending increase is earmarked for poverty relief and other measures aimed at easing the considerable economic pressures arising in Colombia, particularly for the poor, in the wake of the pandemic.
 Even the lower deficit forecast for 2023, however, is still unsustainable for the fiscally fragile South American nation. That means boosting tax revenue is crucial to strengthening a fiscally fragile economy. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data shows that for 2020 that Colombia had a very low tax-to-GDP ratio of 18.7%, the second lowest in the OECD after Mexico. Those numbers, including multiple years with fiscally unsustainable budget deficits, underscore why the national government is seeking to broaden the tax base, improve the collection, hike taxes and boost tax income. That must occur if greater government spending for social programs including urgently needed poverty alleviation is to occur. Fighting poverty is a key element of Colombia’s post-pandemic recovery. By the end of 2021 the Andean country’s national statistics agency, DANE, reported that (Spanish) 19.6 million people in a country with a population of 52 million. This gives Colombia a poverty rate of 39.3% which except for 2020 is the highest since 2012. Socioeconomic inequality has also surged according to the World Bank. Colombia’s GINI coefficient, a key recognized measure of socioeconomic inequality where a lower number is better, soared to 54.2 in 2020 from a decade low of 49.7 in 2017.  To combat an untenable fiscal deficit while boosting government coffers to fund spending for ambitious social programs the newly installed Petro administration introduced a tax reform bill designed to boost fiscal income from taxation. The proposals include (Spanish) hiking taxes for Colombians earning over $10 million pesos or approximately $2,400 per month and placing a levy on heavily process foods as well as beverages. Reforms also include lifting dividend withholding tax, from 10% to 20%, for foreign investors owning shares in Colombian companies. Then there is the proposal to increase taxes levied on extractive industries by implementing a 10% export tax on oil, coal, and gold. That levy will be payable when international oil and coal gold prices exceed a set threshold. The reference prices under consideration are $48 per barrel Brent for crude oil, $87 per metric ton for thermal coal, and $400 per ounce for gold. Colombia’s hydrocarbon regulator the National Hydrocarbon Agency (ANH – Spanish initials) will be tasked with setting the reference price. It is also planned to reduce the deductions energy companies can make from royalty payments. This is on the basis that royalties are not an expense associated with the production of crude oil, but the fee levied by the state for private companies profiting from the extraction of a finite public asset. Petro’s tax reforms, according to Ministry of Finance estimates, will add $5.9 billion to government coffers annually. These developments have triggered considerable market jitters, particularly for participants in Colombia’s petroleum industry. Not only is crude oil the crisis-riven country’s single largest export but the oil industry is struggling to return to pre-pandemic production volumes due to a range of significant headwinds. Then there is Petro’s determination to reduce Colombia’s dependence on extractive industries and transition to sustainable energy which will see an end to contracting for hydrocarbon exploration and ban hydraulic fracturing. While existing production agreements will be allowed to continue plans to wind down Colombia’s petroleum industry, which is responsible for 20% of fiscal revenues, are afoot. Newly appointed Minister of Mines and Energy Irene Velez confirmed (Spanish) that the government will proceed with those plans. Such developments are weighing heavily on the outlook for the domestic oil industry, already under considerable pressure and facing a range of major headwinds, where production volumes of have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels.
 There is, however, still considerable uncertainty as to whether this signals the end of Colombia’s hydrocarbon sector. The urgency with which government revenue must increase to head off a fiscal crisis and fund crucial poverty alleviation programs means the 10% export tax on crude oil will become a critical source of additional income. That may lead to a rethink at the highest levels of government as to how Colombia’s hydrocarbon and other natural resources can be better managed. ",N
Bullish Forecasts Support Crude Prices.html,stock,N
Oil Market Surplus Strengthens Case For New OPEC Output Cuts.html,"This week, OPEC issued its Monthly Oil Market Report. It was released just hours after the IEA released its own monthly oil market forecast. Unlike the IEA, the oil-producing group forecast that growth in oil demand this year would be slower than previously expected. OPEC also forecast an oil market surplus, sparking speculation that it may be preparing for production cuts. According to OPEC’s latest Monthly Oil Market Report, oil demand this year will record a healthy 3.1 million bpd, although the forecast for the second half of the year was revised down because of “expectations of a resurgence of COVID-19 restrictions and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.” Those geopolitical uncertainties are a benevolent euphemism for the war in Ukraine. More interestingly, however, OPEC also calculated the difference between world oil demand for the current quarter and non-OPEC production at 28.27 million bpd, which is what OPEC itself would need to produce to keep the market in balance. This is not an open declaration of production cuts. It is a simple a-b calculation at the end of a table detailing world oil demand and supply. But it does suggest that a reversal of OPEC’s production policies may be on the way, as ZeroHedge suggested in an article published on Thursday. Most of OPEC is already—and still—underperforming its production targets. The cartel and its partners led by Russia did promise to boost production by more than 600,000 bpd in July and August, versus some 420,000 bpd agreed to initially. However, they fell short of that target in July and will likely fall short of it again this month. Then, on top of that, OPEC+ agreed at its latest meeting earlier this month to add a modest 100,000 bpd to total production. Traders were surprised by this addition, and some saw it as a direct slap to Biden after the U.S. president traveled to the Middle East to personally ask Riyadh for more oil. Speaking of Riyadh, the Crown Prince, who effectively runs the Kingdom, made it clear that he won’t be deploying the country’s spare oil production capacity unless the situation with global oil supply becomes critical.
 He used phrases like “severely limited availability” of spare production capacity, although anonymous sources that Reuters talked to said that both Saudi Arabia and the UAE could pump “significantly more” oil should the need for this arise. The question now is whether OPEC sees this as a need.  This latest downward demand revision was the third that the cartel has made since April. The IEA, meanwhile, appears to have realized that the effect of Western sanctions on Russian oil production and exports has been a lot less severe than feared. And this sets the stage for an oil market that is better supplied than many would have expected just a couple of months ago. Of course, it would be careless to ignore demand destruction because of high prices as a factor in the overall decline in oil demand. Yet demand destruction, such as it is, is being balanced out by a surge in gas-to-oil switching, notably in Europe, as utilities and governments struggle with record-breaking gas prices. This week, a tanker of U.S. Mars crude reached Germany in what was the first shipment of such crude ever to that country. The reason: the upcoming Russian oil embargo and the need to urgently find alternatives to Russian crude, especially with the tight gas supply situation getting worse by the day.  Related: The Burgeoning Energy Partnership Between Azerbaijan And The EU The switch from gas to oil, which might well gather pace as heating season draws nearer, could very well turn into a major source of oil demand in the short term. There are also other reasons for bullishness: Reuters reported earlier this week that U.S. refiners and pipeline operators expected strong demand for their product in the second half of the year, despite high prices.
 If demand does turn out to be healthy and strong, then OPEC would not need to take any steps to prop up prices. Brent crude, at the time of writing, was just a dollar shy of $100 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate was above $93 per barrel.  That kind of Brent price should be fine for OPEC. If it falls, however, things can change very quickly. The chances of that happening appear distant, at least according to Goldman Sachs’ Damien Courvalin. In a fresh forecast, Courvalin said the bank’s analysts expected oil prices to swing back to $130 per barrel by the end of the year. “We’re still in deficit. Despite growth slowing, prices still have work to do, and that’s higher from here,” he told Bloomberg. It is always notable when OPEC sees a market surplus where others see a deficit. It normally means the cartel might be preparing for lower production in anticipation of price levels inconsistent with its expectations. Of course, OPEC is well aware of the thin line between doing too little and too much for prices and killing demand, which is why it is unlikely the cartel would stand ready to start cutting output anytime soon. For now, it is enough that OPEC has made it clear spare capacity is limited, and most members cannot produce to their quota. There is only so much a cartel can do, after all.",N
China And The West Both Want To Keep Kazakh Oil Flowing.html,"Since its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has twice blocked Kazakh oil exports crossing its territory. Is this revenge for Kazakhstan’s refusal to endorse the war? An attempt to push up the value of its own crude? Either way, Beijing does not like it. The Chinese government has signaled that it will not accept Russian meddling in Kazakh oil exports, quietly rebuking Moscow for the blockades. Kazakhstan pumps just under 2 million barrels per day (bpd), about 2 percent of global oil production. Almost 80 percent is exported to world markets via the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline that connects the country’s major oil fields with Russia’s Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. This gives Moscow leverage.
 On March 22, Russian authorities claimed that two of three loading facilities at Novorossiysk had been damaged by a storm. In reality, Moscow almost certainly invented a pretext to reduce global supply, raise oil prices to pressure the West into easing sanctions, and aid the Kremlin’s preferred candidate in the French presidential election. The CPC restored full exports after a month. Then, on July 6, a Russian court ordered the CPC to suspend operations for 30 days, citing environmental concerns. This disruption was limited, however, as a higher court ruled on July 11 to restore operations and issued a nominal fine. Both times, oil prices jumped. While the Kremlin does not fear Kazakhstan, it needs Beijing. And China has significant economic interests in Kazakhstan, the gateway to its Belt and Road Initiative of global transportation infrastructure. Chinese companies are important players in Kazakhstan’s oil and gas industries. Although little Kazakh crude is physically shipped to China, China has an interest in seeing it reach global markets; without these shipments, oil prices would rise, global consumer demand for goods would weaken, and China’s export-oriented growth would take a hit. Finally, all three existing legs of the Central Asia-China gas pipeline transit Kazakhstan, delivering critical energy supplies. With the Chinese economy slowing, in part thanks to higher energy prices, Beijing needs Kazakhstan to export every molecule possible.  Related: The Burgeoning Energy Partnership Between Azerbaijan And The EU
 Though Beijing is loath to publicly break with Moscow, the PRC has subtly warned Moscow about intruding too deeply in world oil markets. Three days after the CPC was first closed, Sinopec halted a major investment in Russia. That same day, Bloomberg reported that Chinese companies and government officials were “rushing” to learn how to comply with Western sanctions on Russia, while the Chinese Foreign Ministry reportedly warned state-owned energy firms to avoid any “hasty” purchases that could present secondary sanctions risk. Additionally, the China National Petroleum Corporation reposted a history of natural gas in Beijing, detailing the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline network but conspicuously omitting the $55 billion, Russia-to-China Power of Siberia pipeline that opened in 2019. As the global economy contends with inflation and slowing growth, and China deals with the consequences of rolling COVID lockdowns, Beijing has little tolerance for further economic disruptions. Additional Russian restrictions on CPC exports would be an unwelcome distraction for President Xi Jinping as he seeks an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Communist Party Congress later this year. Beijing is not on the West’s side in the Ukraine conflict. Yet even as tensions over Taiwan threaten cooperation, policymakers in China and the West should see that they have a shared interest in preserving Kazakh oil flows should Russia block exports again.",N
Its Time For An Oil And Gas Boom In Africa.html,"Several African countries have been gradually boosting their oil and gas output over the last year, as demand for fossil fuels continues to rise. While many countries in the West are curbing their fossil fuel operations, the African region is offering major oil firms the opportunity to develop new, low-carbon oil operations in largely untapped areas. But will governments that want to develop their oil industries be able to successfully make their case at COP27?  Several leaders of African countries are expected to present the case for new fossil fuel projects to go ahead across the continent at the next global climate summit in November, according to media sources. Africa is offering the world access to vital gas resources at a time when many countries are facing energy shortages and rising prices. In addition, Africa’s largely unexplored oil reserves could provide the world with the low-carbon resources needed to bridge the gap in the renewable energy transition. But with many world leaders aiming to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels to support the battle against climate change, it is uncertain whether these leaders will convince the rest of the world of the need for African oil and gas.  A five-page document by the African Union highlighting support for the development of oil and gas operations across most African states will likely be presented at COP27, according to the Guardian. In the document, the Union says: “In the short to medium term, fossil fuels, especially natural gas will have to play a crucial role in expanding modern energy access in addition to accelerating the uptake of renewables.” But not everyone is happy about the stance of the African leaders, with a coalition of African NGOs calling their actions “shameful” and “unacceptable”. Environmentalists highlight the significant potential for the development of large-scale renewable energy projects across the African continent, which is already being hit hard by climate change. Many worry that the actions taken at COP27 could lead to a future of Africa becoming reliant on fossil fuels, rather than being part of the global green transition.   However, rapidly increasing oil and gas prices have recently led many countries to reassess their stance on oil and gas, with several boosting output to meet demand. As the E.U. and U.S. strengthen sanctions on Russian energy, many governments are having to turn elsewhere to fill the gap. In addition, the E.U. announced as part of its climate change strategy this year that the region would continue to rely on natural gas as part of a cleaner energy transition, as it moves away from coal and crude oil. 
 This is not the first time Africa is presenting its potential as a new oil region to the rest of the world. Following several fossil fuel developments in the last few years, many African leaders have stated their support for the industry. The argument mainly centers around the idea that many highly-developed countries have already profited from oil and gas, leaving Africa behind, and now is the time for the region to profit from its resources and develop its economies.  So how can the African region position itself to ensure that it profits from its natural resources at a time when the world appears to be moving away from new fossil fuel projects? McKinsey research suggests that many of Africa’s current oil and gas operations are more expensive than the global average, making energy firms reluctant to invest in the region. However, their study suggests that three dimensions could help Africa better position itself in the oil and gas market over the coming decades.   Related: The Most Overlooked Equity Market In The World Right Now Firstly, the region must work to decarbonize operations while improving cost efficiencies. To ensure that Africa remains attractive for energy investment, the region must reduce the emissions produced in its oil and gas operations. This can be done through the introduction of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. The region has the potential to massively reduce its flared gas and other waste to be recycled and reused in other projects, such as in the production of grey hydrogen. In addition, state governments must enhance their energy industry legislation and regulations to improve the cost competitiveness of operations, with a focus on inefficiencies and insecurity.  
 Secondly, Africa should increase its energy supply through lower-carbon infrastructure projects. Many oil majors are walking away from their existing oil projects in favor of low-carbon alternatives. As long-explored basins are drying up, a plethora of oil and gas firms are looking to untapped regions to develop more favorable low-carbon operations in areas with greater longevity prospects. Investment in gas projects, including gas pipelines, processing infrastructure, and liquified petroleum gas (LPG), will also support the global renewable energy transition, as demand for natural gas is expected to remain high for decades to come.   And lastly, countries across Africa must increase their investment in renewable energy projects. As African states see their oil wealth grow, they must invest in renewable energy projects alongside oil and gas operations to eventually shift their reliance away from finite fossil fuels.  The African region has great potential to develop its fossil fuel industry at a time when demand remains high and the world is facing shortages of both natural gas and oil. If done effectively, the region could become more self-sufficient, as well as export energy to the rest of the world to help develop its national economies. However, with the world moving away from oil and gas in favor of renewable alternatives, it is uncertain whether African leaders will be successful in their attempt to convince representatives at COP27 of the need for African oil and gas.",N
Asia Gobbles Up Cheap US Crude At OPECs Expense.html,"Asian buyers have bought a substantial amount of cheap U.S. crude on the spot market, suggesting that demand for Middle Eastern grades will be lower in the immediate future, Bloomberg reports, citing traders. According to them, South Korean and Indian refiners had bought some 16 million barrels of U.S. crude on the spot market so far this month, with most of the oil to be delivered in November. That’s twice as much as they bought in July but still a little less than they bought over the first five months of the year. The price differential between West Texas Intermediate and Middle Eastern grades became favorable amid an unexpected decline in U.S. gasoline demand this summer, which led to lower WTI prices. At the same time, Middle Eastern crude remained relatively expensive.
 Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, one of the biggest suppliers to Asian countries, raised its official selling prices for oil to a record high earlier this month, with the flagship Arab Light hitting a $9.80-per-brrel premium to the Oman/Dubai benchmark. South Korea and India are both overwhelmingly reliant on imported crude for their consumption. South Korea relies on imported commodities for more than 93 percent of its consumption of energy and natural resources. In oil, it imports more than 73 percent from the Middle East.
 India, for its part, relies on imports for more than 80 percent of the oil it consumes. Like South Korea, it imports most of its oil from Middle Eastern suppliers, although this year, Indian oil buyers have embraced discounted Russian crude amid Western sanctions. Earlier this year, Russia became India’s second-largest oil supplier, after Iraq and before Saudi Arabia, with the sanction-prompted discount in Russian oil prices making up for higher freight costs. Looking ahead, Bloomberg’s trading sources sounded a cautious note, pointing out that refining margins in Asia have been falling, with some refiners thinking about reducing their run rates in this environment. This suggests that Asian oil buyers’ appetite could decline in the coming months.",N
OPEC Sets The Stage For New Output Cuts.html,"Biden's ""hard-won"", post Saudi fist-bump OPEC output boost of 100K barrels may end up being not only the smallest on record, but also the shortest. In its latest monthly report, OPEC revealed that it expects global oil markets to tip into surplus this quarter as it downgraded the outlook for demand and bolstered estimates for rival supplies. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut forecasts for the amount of crude it will need to pump in the third quarter by 1.24 million barrels a day to 28.27 million  - according to Bloomberg, that’s about 570,000 barrels a day less than OPEC’s 13 members pumped in July. The surprising revision, which comes at a time of unprecedented pressure by western nations in general and the US in particular on the non-Russian countries in OPEC+, conspicuously diverges from that of the International Energy Agency, which boosted its demand forecasts on Thursday as soaring natural gas prices compel companies and refiners to switch to using oil, in effect confirming what we said two days ago when we noted that Europe's aggressive gas-oil switching amid US oil exports to Europe likely set the lows for US gasoline prices. FIRST EVER CARGO OF U.S. MARS CRUDE OIL DISCHARGED IN GERMANY'S ROSTOCK PORT -TRACKING, SOURCES
 European gas-oil switching just put the lows for US gasoline prices  Specifically, in its own monthly report, the Paris-based IEA forecast that world oil consumption will increase by 2.1 million barrels a day this year, or about 2%, up 380,000 a day from the previous forecast. The extra demand that prompted the revision is “overwhelmingly concentrated” in the Middle East and Europe. At the basis of the IEA's upward demand revision is a surge in gas-to-oil switching. Bloomberg explains:
 Natural gas prices have surged this year as Russia restricts gas flows to Europe, a move that is widely seen as retaliation for sanctions imposed over its invasion of Ukraine. The increase has prompted many industrial consumers, including refiners and power plants, to switch from gas to oil. Scorching temperatures have also spurred demand for air conditioning, particularly in the Middle East, where a significant amount of oil is burned during summer to generate electricity.  Always a political organization, however, OPEC’s outlook is likely meant to give further ""explanation"" for the minimal production increase it agreed on with its allies last week, if not set the stage for future production cuts? OPEC+ ""surprised"" traders at the Aug. 3 meeting with plans to add just 100,000 barrels a day in September - the smallest increase in history - despite calls from US President Joe Biden to open the taps during a visit to group leader Saudi Arabia last month. The alliance explained the move by saying it had to deploy “severely limited” spare production capacity with “great caution.” OPEC’s Vienna-based research department reduced forecasts for global oil demand this quarter by 720,000 barrels a day, and boosted projections for non-OPEC supply by 520,000 a day. It expects consumption to average 99.93 million barrels a day in the three-month period.",N
OPEC Oil Production Could Dip In September.html,"The 100,000 bpd production target increase that OPEC+ set for September may end up effectively being a production cut, the IEA said on Thursday, with a possible dip in Russian production. OPEC+ is unlikely, the IEA said, to increase production in the coming months because they are short on spare capacity. “Comparatively low levels of operational spare production capacity, held mainly by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, may thus all but rule out substantial further OPEC+ output increases in the coming months,” the IEA”s new Oil Market Report-August 2022 reads.
 This will place the burden of meeting the anticipated 2.1 million bpd 2023 demand growth squarely on the shoulders of those producers that lie outside OPEC+, the IEA said. The IEA noted, however, that while they were still expecting a decline in Russian crude oil production, it had revised its outlook for world oil supply upwards, with Russia’s supply declines now seen as more limited than it previously forecast. According to new IEA data, OPEC-10’s spare capacity is 2.73 million bpd, with the total OPEC spare capacity at 3.38 million bpd. The IEA estimates the total OPEC+ effective spare capacity at 3.74 million bpd.
 OPEC+, however, is not eager to tap into this effective spare capacity, which would diminish the group’s power to respond to market emergencies with increased production. After OPEC+’s last meeting in early August, OPEC+ referred to its “severely limited” spare capacity, which should be used with “great caution in response to severe supply disruptions”, reinforcing the IEA’s predictions that additional OPEC+ output increases are unlikely in the coming months. Global crude oil inventories are now expected to grow 900,000 bpd for the rest of the year, and 500,000 bpd over 2023 H1, August’s Oil Market Report said.",P
Oil Inches Higher After EIA Reports Large Crude Inventory Build.html,"Crude oil prices inched down before the EIA reported its crude inventory report today, but saw a small jump after the release, when the agency reported that crude oil inventories had added 5.5 million barrels in the week to August 5.  A week earlier, inventories added 4.5 million barrels, according to the EIA, which added to downward pressure on prices. In fuels, the picture was mixed.
 Gasoline inventories fell by 5 million barrels in the week to August 5, compared with a modest increase of 200,000 barrels for the previous week. Gasoline production increased, averaging 10.2 million barrels daily last week, which compared with 9.3 million barrels daily a week earlier. In middle distillates, which have fallen to critical levels this year, the EIA estimated an inventory build of 2.2 million barrels for the week to August 5. This compared with a draw of 2.4 million barrels for the previous week. Middle distillate production averaged 5.1 million bpd last week, compared with 4.9 million bpd in the previous week.
 U.S. distillate inventories have fallen to dangerously low levels and from this moment on, Reuters’ John Kemp wrote last week, “either an imminent recession reduces consumption or prices are likely to surge higher.” Neither is a very palpable option for the Biden administration, which has been boasting about the steady decline in the past few weeks. According to EIA data cited by Kemp, distillate fuels have declined in 66 of the last 109 weeks with the accumulated draw since July 2020 at 65 million barrels. In this context, signs are emerging that U.S. manufacturing activity may be set for a decline in the second half of this year, after peaking in the second quarter, according to the Reuters market analyst. Meanwhile, refineries continued to operate at high run rates, the average standing at 94.3 percent of capacity last week. Refineries processed an average of 16.6 million barrels of crude daily. This compared to 15.9 million bpd for the previous week, with capacity utilization at 91 percent.",P
OPECs July Production Survey Shows Another Big Miss.html,"Despite raising its crude oil production in July by 500,000 barrels per day, the OPEC+ group was still well below its collective quota, pumping 2.75 million bpd below targeted output, an Argus survey found on Wednesday. OPEC+ saw its combined crude oil production at 38.70 million bpd last month, with Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s top producer and de facto leader, raising its supply to the market the most. According to the survey and preliminary tanker-tracking from Argus, Saudi Arabia’s crude oil shipments jumped by more than 550,000 bpd in July compared to June, and stood at some 7.37 million bpd last month. However, not all the crude in the tracked high export levels came from a rise in the Kingdom’s oil production. Some volumes came from Saudi stockpiles, Argus noted. Between 60,000 bpd and 120,000 bpd of the jump in Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports likely came from stockpiles, analysts have told Argus.
 OPEC is set to release data on its members’ production for July on Thursday, August 11. Nigeria, the top African producer at OPEC, was a major laggard in production, again, despite vowing to start pumping to quota by the end of August. Nigeria’s July production, however, failed to increase amid a force majeure at the Bonny Light terminal, according to the Argus survey. Elsewhere in the OPEC+ group, Russian oil production increased marginally, the Argus survey showed.
 Libya, exempted from the OPEC+ deal, raised production and exports after lifting a force majeure in the middle of July. The 500,000-bpd July increase of the collective OPEC+ oil production was lower than the 648,000-bpd rise the alliance had set for each of the months of July and August, after which it will have rolled back all the cuts from May 2020. Last week, OPEC+ gave the go-ahead to raise the collective oil production target for September by 100,000 bpd as recommended by the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC).",P
A Worrying Signal From Oil Traders Of A European Recession.html,"Recession has always been a politically sensitive word. Today, it has become so sensitive that some economists and politicians are trying to redefine it to make it lose some of its sting. The reality of a recession, however, is impossible to redefine. In Europe in particular, consumers are feeling the slowdown in economic growth in their wallets, and so are traders. There is one big difference between the two though. When a recession is looming, consumers curb spending. Traders, on the other hand, begin selling. Reuters’ John Kemp reported in his latest hedge fund column that hedge funds and other institutional traders sold the equivalent of 1 million barrels of European gas oil futures over the past three weeks. While this may not sound like a lot, over the last six weeks, total sales have added up to 20 million barrels. A significant reduction in the net position of traders.  Across the Atlantic, hedge funds and money managers have been buying U.S. diesel futures and options, increasing their position by 13 million barrels over the last three weeks. Kemp suggests this is a signal that the economic outlook of U.S. traders is brighter than that of their European peers. It might be that U.S. traders are simply looking to profit from the diesel shortage Kemp himself wrote about earlier this month. He noted that U.S. distillate fuel inventories have fallen to critical levels, and it would take a recession to remedy things by destroying demand. Otherwise, diesel prices will only continue rising and traders would buy diesel futures. Be that as it may, the danger of recession in Europe is certainly a lot more serious from an energy perspective. Unlike the U.S., which is rather self-sufficient when it comes to natural gas, Europe has revealed itself to be as embarrassingly dependent on imports of the commodity. A dash for gas has followed, where Europe is scouring the world for friendly gas, under a spot contract, if possible. It has not always been possible.
 As a result of this, Europe is now diverting cargoes from Asia, which is not making it any friends there, and trying to consume less energy. Thanks to excessive prices, it is consuming less energy. Germany is preparing for energy rationing for industrial users and encouraging household austerity. Spain is mandating air-conditioners be kept at 27 degrees or above. And Norway just announced that it would curb its electricity exports to the EU.  Related: Copper Prices Slide Sideways As Bulls And Bears Battle It Out Norwegian electricity normally goes to the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Denmark. However, hydropower output, which accounts for the bulk of Norway’s total electricity output, has been low this year, and the country is trying to secure local sufficiency. More bad news for struggling Europe, where renewable power output remains uneven. The picture is not pretty, and earlier this month, the IMF signaled it could become even worse as it advised European governments to pass on the additional energy costs to consumers to encourage energy savings. The fund argued that financial aid only keeps energy consumption high when it should be going down. Meanwhile, Nomura analysts recently forecast that the eurozone, along with the UK, the U.S., South Korea, Australia, and Canada, are among the countries facing recession in 2023.
 “Right now central banks, many of them have shifted to essentially a single mandate — and that’s to get inflation down. Monetary policy credibility is too precious an asset to lose. So they’re going to be very aggressive,” Nomura’s head of global markets research, Rob Subbaraman, said last month. Add to this central bank aggressiveness the equally aggressive stance the EU is taking in its standoff with Russia, and there’s a recipe for recession right there.  Reuters’ Kemp predicted that at least four European economies will fall into a recession before the year’s end. Unfortunately, it’s the four largest - Germany, France, Italy, and Britain - which means the pain will be felt across the bloc and the rest of Europe, too. The silver lining: fuel prices might begin to fall once a recession settles in.",P
How High Can US Shale Production Climb.html,"The shale drilling boom that ended in March of 2020, as the full effects of the pandemic hit the economy, contributed to a surplus of oil in storage that kept prices down. Richly supplied both in the U.S. and globally, the market took the spot delivery prices down to unprecedented levels. In April 2020, the spot price actually went negative for the first time ever.  As the economy recovered, inventory levels declined, bottoming out in March of this year, at about 415 mm bbls across all PADD districts. Not only did storage decline, but U.S. production declined sharply in this period as the low prices made much of it uneconomic to drill. Rigs were stacked like cordwood in the outskirts of Midland, with the active rig count falling to 252 by June 2020. As we moved into the third quarter, WTI prices surpassed $40 and rigs began to go back to work. Over the course of 2021/22, another 500+ rigs were added with about 40% of that coming this year as drillers moved to take advantage of still low rig rates and WTI prices in the $80-$120 range. A combination that doesn’t often present itself.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent oil above $100 per barrel, causing gasoline and diesel prices to soar and consumers to suffer a lot of pain at the pump. At the same time, the recovering economy and the loosening of Covid restrictions created a surge in travel, both on the open road and in the air. There has been an expectation from regulators and politicians that oil companies would take their increased revenues and hire more rigs to bring down prices. A practice that would have fit their former model of compound annual growth rate - CAGR, using borrowed capital, and nearly brought many of them to ruin in the years leading up to 2020.  Instead, the shale drillers, now wiser, have adopted a practice of capital restraint that has the objective of maintaining production at current levels with a slight bias to growth. Attending the JP Morgan Energy Conference in Houston last June, Pioneer Natural Resources, (NYSE:PXD) CEO was quoted addressing this issue in an Oil and Gas Journal article. “We’re [Pioneer] only going to grow 5% per year; I’ve been asked that in every meeting today,” Sheffield told attendees at the June 22 event. “We’re not going to grow 7, 8, 9, 10, 12%,"" he said, noting that the company told the Biden administration the same thing when asked to increase production. ""We said no to them also,"" Sheffield continued. ""We’re trying to get them to understand the model and the reasons the model changed,"" he said, in discussing a past model of boom-bust cycles in which the oil and gas industry responded by ramping up production that ended in oversupply.” Other CEOs have made similar commentary, stressing that their priority for capital allocation is not production growth, but the return of capital to shareholders. Another large shale driller, Devon Energy, (NYSE:DVN) has made the same commitment. Devon CEO, Rick Muncrief noted in a Bloomberg interview that the company would continue to be disciplined in capital allocation with a growth target for 2022 of ~5%.
 What hasn’t gotten a lot of attention is an external, natural limit to growth in shale production. Shale drillers in the lean times chose to develop their best locations to ensure payouts that would return more revenue than they cost to drill. (I discussed this trend in an earlier Oilprice article last May.) The industry calls these Tier I locations. The linked Rystad article notes the following in regard to remaining Tier I locations. “Taken together, the inventory size corresponds to 18-25 years of drilling at the pace expected in 2020. If Tier 1 activity returns to the record level of 2019, then we can have six-eight years of drilling capacity in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and 11-15 years in the DJ Basin and Permian. In the Permian Basin, the total size of the remaining Tier 1 inventory is about 33,000 locations, assuming there are no changes in the current well spacing strategies.” Rystad While a significant amount of Tier I acreage remains, there are signs the wells now being developed contained a higher mix of lower-tier rock. The chart below, compiled from the EIA-DPR’s published data reveals a troubling trend in overall shale activity, with a particular focus on the Permian basin. The Permian basin contributes over half of U.S. shale production.  The DPR monthly report makes a simple calculation of individual well productivity per rig by dividing the production for that month (shown two months in arrears), by the number of active rigs. The data is revelatory in the following respects. The blue line, representing all eight basins tabulated in the report, trends down over the last year, while the total rig count as reported by Baker Hughes is rising sharply. The orange line, representing the Permian basin, follows the same trajectory, with daily production declining per well by about 120 bbl per day over this time. What is additionally noteworthy about this data is while production is declining as rigs are added - something that is a little counter-intuitive - the rates of monthly DUC-Drilled but Uncompleted wells and withdrawals are also declining. This is suggestive that the daily production rate per rig, already on the downslope, was boosted artificially by operators fracking an already drilled well to turn it inline.  I next turned to the EIA-914, the monthly report of all producing states put out by the agency. The 914 report also contains data 2-months in arrears, and in this case shows the data through May. I took all states producing more than 400K BOEPD and tracked their output.
  Note-the Total U.S. line is plotted on the right-hand Y axis What it shows is that across all key basins production has been relatively flat for most of the past year, and in particular for 2022. Since the Gulf of Mexico is included in this total there are some weather anomalies that can skew the overall data temporarily, with the same being true for onshore production in wintertime. Your takeaway We may yet add another 800K BOEPD by the end of next year as the EIA Short Term Energy Outlook-STEO suggests we may. You never want to say never until time passes. The data I’ve reviewed says otherwise, however. What this means for oil prices is yet unclear in the short term as for the last six weeks concerns about a possible recession have trimmed roughly $20 per barrel from the price of WTI and Brent. Longer term, if this trend toward lower well productivity bears out, we could see a sharp reversal higher, as shale output declines. Many analyst firms have kept a YE-2022 exit price target above current levels, with Goldman Sachs the most bullish of all at $135 for Brent. If all of these things come together consumers could be in for more pain in the pocketbook, as tight supplies result in higher prices.",P
All Hopes Are Dashed For International Oil Companies In North Iraq.html,"Any hopes held by international oil companies (IOCs) that the Baghdad-based Federal Government of Iraq (FGI) was just bluffing about blacklisting IOCs operating in the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq have been dashed. A letter sent on 12 June by Hassan Muhammad Hassan, the deputy director general of the state-run Basra Oil Company (BOC) called on ‘all lead contractors and sub-contractors’ of IOCs working in Iraqi Kurdistan to pledge that they would no longer work in Kurdistan and that any current contracts should be terminated within three months. This has been followed up in the last few days with an order from the BOC director general, Khalid Abbas, to ‘all lead contractors’ that orders them to ‘suspend dealing with the following subcontractors and never invite them to any future works or projects in BOC oil fields as per the licensing contracts signed with your companies.’ According to local reports, multiple oil companies working in the northern Iraq Kurdistan region (including DNO, Western Zagros, Gulf Keystone, Genel Energy, and ShaMaran Petroleum received a letter on 19 May summoning them to appear at the Commercial Court in Baghdad on 5 June), whilst the most notable of the four IOCs blacklisted a few days ago was U.S.-Irish oilfield services giant, Weatherford International, according to Iraq news sources. These moves were all presaged by two landmark legal rulings made in February by the Supreme Court of the Federal Government of Iraq in Baghdad, analysed in depth at the time by OilPrice.com. The first of these is that sales of oil and gas by the government of the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of Iraq (the KRG), based in Erbil, done independently of the central government in Baghdad, is unconstitutional and that the KRG must hand over all oil production to the Federal Government of Iraq, represented by the Ministry of Oil. The second ruling, and an even greater direct threat to all oil and gas operations of IOCs operating in the northern region, is that the Ministry of Oil has the right to: “Follow up on the invalidity of oil contracts concluded by the Kurdistan Regional Government with foreign parties, countries and companies regarding oil exploration, extraction, export and sale.”  Legally, the issue of what oil (and gas) resources the Kurdistan region in the north or the Federal region in the south owns is unclear. According to the KRG, it has authority under Articles 112 and 115 of the Iraq Constitution to manage oil and gas in the Kurdistan Region extracted from fields that were not in production in 2005 – the year that the Constitution was adopted by referendum. In addition, the KRG maintains that Article 115 states: “All powers not stipulated in the exclusive powers of the federal government belong to the authorities of the regions and governorates that are not organised in a region.” As such, the KRG maintains that as relevant powers are not otherwise stipulated in the Constitution, it has the authority to sell and receive revenue from its oil and gas exports. The KRG also highlights that the Constitution provides that, should a dispute arise, priority shall be given to the law of the regions and governorates. However, the FGI in Baghdad and Iraq’s State Organization for Marketing of Oil (SOMO) argue that under Article 111 of the Constitution oil and gas are under the ownership of all the people of Iraq in all the regions and governorates. 
 A practical solution to this enduring legal problem was agreed on by both sides in November 2014 and the agreement was that the KRG in the north would export up to 550,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from the northern region of Kurdistan’s oilfields and Kirkuk via the Baghdad-based SOMO in the south. In return, Baghdad would send 17 percent of the federal budget after sovereign expenses (around US$500 million at that time) per month in budget payments to the Kurds. Although apparently fair to both sides, the agreement rarely functioned as it should, with the KRG frequently, and accurately, being cited by the FGI in Baghdad of selling oil independently of SOMO, as per the agreement, and the FGI in Baghdad being cited frequently, and accurately, by the KRG of not dispersing the requisite funds from the budget on time or in the correct amounts. This already difficult situation was complicated further by the involvement initially of Iran and then of Russia after it effectively took control of the northern Iraq oil sector in 2017, as analysed in-depth in my latest book on the global oil markets. The unwillingness of the FGI in Baghdad to upset Iran in the first instance, given the ongoing influence that Tehran exerted over Baghdad via its military, economic, and political proxies, and then not to offend Russia, given its deadly build-out of influence across the region from that point in 2017, meant that no effective substitute deal for the 2014 agreement was made.  Two key events, though, have conspired to give Baghdad the confidence to take the harder line on the KRG that the oil market is now seeing. The first of these was the U.S.’s ‘end of combat mission’ in Iraq in December 2021, and its similar withdrawal from Afghanistan a few months earlier – seen together by many leaders in the Middle East (and China and Russia) as a signal of a broader retreat by Washington from long-running political, economic, and military missions without a clear end-goal in sight. Indeed, former U.S. President Donald Trump had said as much not long before: “We are restoring the fundamental principles, that the job of the American soldier is not to rebuild foreign nations but defend and defend strongly our nation from foreign enemies. We are ending the era of endless wars. In its place is a renewed, clear-eyed focus on defending America’s vital interests. It is not the duty of U.S. troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never even heard of. We are not the policemen of the world.” The second factor that has emboldened Baghdad has been Russia’s increasing marginalisation in the global geopolitical mix since it invaded Ukraine in February. These two factors together appear to have catalysed Baghdad’s resolve to move to consolidate all of Iraq’s oil and gas industry into one countrywide hydrocarbons sector from now on, administered from Baghdad, regardless of any considerations relating to the KRG in the north. The marginalisation of both the U.S. and Russia, at least overtly and at least for the time being, also appears to be a key factor behind the withdrawal from parliament of Moqtada al-Sadr and his 73-member power bloc, the largest in the legislative body. His calls for new elections are part of what he regards as a no-lose situation for him, according to a senior Iraq political source spoken to by OilPrice.com last week. “On the one hand, if they go ahead, then he can expect his bloc to gain even more seats, but if they don’t then there is no head of government, which means he [al-Sadr] still calls the shots,” he said.
 Precisely what al-Sadr wants longer-term is difficult to pin down, the source added, but – despite the firebrand cleric leading countless bloody and effective assaults against U.S. troops from 2003 to 2008 and opposing several Iranian initiatives in Iraq – it may be that he is more of a pragmatist than is widely assumed. “Fundamentally, he does believe in one Iraq - and one Iraq only - not beholden to any other country, and free from any such external political interference, but he is clever and pragmatic, and he knows how to make deals with those who can sponsor him to the top leadership position for a long period of time, and that is where we are now,” the source concluded.",P
China Oil Imports Pick Up After Slump.html,"China’s crude oil imports rose slightly in July amid a general improvement in commodity imports during that month, Bloomberg reported, citing official data released by Beijing on Sunday. Crude oil imports stood at 37.33 million tons last month, the data showed, although an increase from a four-year low booked earlier in the year was still lower than they were at the start of the year and a year ago. The total amount is equal to about 8.8 million bpd. Earlier this month, energy analytics firm OilX estimated that China’s oil imports would pick up modestly in July, seeing them at 9.3 million bpd, or half a million bpd higher than the June average.
 The news about China’s recovering oil imports following demand destruction amid Covid lockdowns and economic growth worries immediately prompted a rise in oil prices, coupled with robust export data, also released by Beijing over the weekend. Even so, oil imports remain weaker than they could be, capping any price gains for the time being as the appetite for the commodity remains restrained. This restraint was probably one of the reasons ANZ revised down its oil demand outlook for this year and next. For this year, the Australian bank revised its demand outlook down by 300,000 bpd, and for 2023, it cut its forecast by half a million barrels daily.
 China’s zero-Covid policy has been behind much of the uncertainty about oil demand, especially after data showed that Chinese refinery run rates had fallen for the first time in a decade during the first half of the year. That’s despite a rise in domestic oil production to an all-time high of 4.18 million bpd in June. The zero-Covid policy pummeled the Chinese economy during the second quarter of the year, leading to sharp drops in manufacturing activity and consumer spending. The rise in oil imports and the imports of other commodities suggest that a reversal of fortunes may be on the way, although uncertainty remains rife.",P
Kazakhstans 300000 Bpd Kashagan Oilfield Halts Output.html,"The offshore oilfield Kashagan in Kazakhstan, which pumps more than 300,000 barrels per day (bpd), was shut down on Thursday after a gas leak was detected on the site, the field operator said on Friday. “NCOC, the Operator of the North Caspian Project, confirms that on 3 August 2022, Bolashak Onshore Processing Facility was safely shut down as a result of the detection of a gas release within the perimeter of the site. As per standard procedure, following the gas detectors activation, the facilities have been depressurized to the flare system,” the operator said in a statement today. In the first quarter of this year, oil production from the Kashagan oilfield dropped to an average of 317,000 bpd, down by 2 percent compared to the same period of 2021.
 No people were harmed, and no excessive pollution was detected following the gas leak detected on Thursday, the company added. “Works are currently underway to resume production operations,” NCOC said, without specifying when production would resume. As a result of the suspended oil operations at Kashagan, the oil volumes received in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) system have been reduced, the consortium said on Thursday.
 The 1,500-km CPC pipeline from the giant Kazakh oilfields to the Russian port on the Black Sea, Novorossiysk, moves over two-thirds of all Kazakhstan export oil along with crude from Russian fields, including those in the Caspian region.   The suspension of the Kashagan oilfield comes weeks after a Russian court ordered last month the suspension of most of Kazakhstan’s crude oil exports Novorossiysk. The ruling was later overturned by a Russian court of appeals. The exports take place from the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea. While the port is in Russia, CPC exports consist of 90 percent crude from Kazakhstan and just 10 percent of Russian oil.  ",P
Russia Displaces Saudi Arabian Oil In India.html,"Russia’s share of the Indian oil market is growing at the expense of Saudi imports, Bloomberg has reported, noting Russian oil has been selling at a sizeable discount to Saudi crude. Russia became the second-biggest oil supplier to India in June, after Iraq, which remained the biggest oil supplier to the subcontinent. India and China became key markets for Russian oil after the Ukraine invasion as Europe began to wind down its purchases. The EU plans to suspend almost all imports of Russian crude and fuels by the end of the year, when an embargo will come into effect.
 China and India, however, have only been too happy to absorb some of the crude that Europe is shunning, with both Asian giants dependent on imports for their energy consumption. As of July, the two accounted for 55 percent of Russian seaborne oil exports. The change in oil sourcing has been particularly marked in India, which relies on imported crude for some 85 percent of its consumption. Last year, Russia was far from the top suppliers of the subcontinent: it ranked ninth. Now, thanks to the cheaper Russian crude, things look very different. “Indian refiners are going to try and get their hands on the cheapest crude possible that works with their refinery and product configurations,” Bloomberg quoted oil market analyst Vandana Hari as saying.
 In May, according to Bloomberg calculations, Russian oil sold for $19 less per barrel than Saudi crude, which narrowed in June to $13 per barrel. “Russian crude fits that bill for now. The Saudis and Iraqis are not entirely losing out because they are directing more supply to Europe,” Hari added. Indeed, Middle East oil producers were the natural alternative for European buyers, along with U.S, producers, as the buyers sought to replace Russian crude.",P
Why Oil And Gas Executives Are Reluctant To Pull The Trigger On New Deals.html,"The last two energy crises that threatened hundreds of energy companies with bankruptcy have rewritten the O&G M&A playbook. Previously, oil and gas companies made numerous aggressive tactical or cyclical acquisitions in the wake of a price crash after many distressed assets became available on the cheap. However, the 2020 oil price crash that sent oil prices into negative territory has seen energy companies adopt a more restrained, strategic, and environment-focused approach to cutting M&A deals. It’s therefore hardly surprising that Big Oil executives have become increasingly hesitant to pull the trigger after the last M&A wave turned into a disaster for acquiring companies. According to data released by energy analytics firm Enverus, U.S. oil and gas dealmaking contracted 65% Y/Y to $12 billion last quarter, a far cry from $34.8 billion in last year’s corresponding period, as high commodity price volatility left buyers and sellers clashing over asset values. ""The spike in commodity prices that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine temporarily stalled M&A as buyers and sellers disagreed on the value of assets,"" said Andrew Dittmar, a director at Enverus Intelligence Research. U.S. benchmark crude oil futures prices briefly spiked to more than $130 a barrel in early March, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, but prices have since cooled thanks to recession worries, a fresh wave of Covid-19 as well as demand destruction concerns. Last quarter's high oil and gas prices triggered a rebound in M&A activity, especially from private equity firms. Enervous has reported that deals by private equity firms saw a significant uptick in the first quarter as they bought assets that oil companies deemed as non-core to their development plans. These assets tended to lay outside oil-prolific areas like the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. Related: Saudi Arabia And The UAE Won’t Be Tapping Emergency Oil Capacity
 “Private equity still has dry powder for deals. They are using this to target assets being tagged as non-core by public companies. Once you step out of the core of the Permian Basin and a few other key areas, competition for deals drops, and these positions are often available at buyer-friendly price points. That said, private equity is still a net seller in the space and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future given the number of investments outstanding and how long that capital has been deployed,” Dittmar has remarked. Further, there are growing concerns that high oil prices might have caused significant demand destruction, which could hamper an oil price recovery. On Wednesday, we saw crude oil futures give up their modest gains and dip lower after data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) revealed unexpected increases in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories. On Thursday, WTI September crude oil fell to $88 per barrel while October Brent crude fell to $94 per barrel. U.S. crude inventories jumped by 4.5M barrels to 426.6M barrels, with crude oil stored at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub increasing by 926K barrels from the previous week to 24.5M barrels, while gasoline stockpiles added 163K barrels to 225.3M barrels. The four-week average of U.S. gasoline consumption is now more than 1M bbl/day below pre-COVID seasonal levels, despite pump prices having fallen for 50 straight days. There’s another reason though why Big Oil has gone cold on M&A. M&A Disaster
 Cowen analysts have pointed out how the last M&A wave turned into a disaster for the acquiring companies. In 2020,  Shell Plc (NYSE: SHEL) cut its dividend by a hefty 66%. That marked the first time the company cut the dividend since WWII, a testament of just how severe the oil massacre was, which is what Shell blamed in its press release. However, another culprit was blamed for the dramatic cut: the company’s 2016 acquisition of BG Group, which set it back a whopping $60B. Occidental Petroleum’s (NYSE: OXY) $55B leveraged purchase of Anadarko quickly became the poster-child of oil and gas mergers gone bad. The deal quickly turned into a nightmare, leaving the company in deep distress over its mountain of debt and water cooler wisecracks of how it could itself get acquired at a fraction of what it paid for Anadarko. Cowen also pointed at BP Plc.’s (NYSE:BP) high debt, though it might have less to do with its 2018 merger with BHP Billiton for $10.5B and more to do with its Deepwater Horizon oil spill which has cost it a staggering $65B in clean-up costs and legal fees over the years. BP’s debt-to-equity ratio of 0.96 is more than double the oil and gas sector’s average of 0.44, and the highest among the oil supermajors.  Luckily, the situation has improved dramatically since the 2020 oil price crash, with the vast majority of shale companies now printing millions in profits and free cash flow even at current oil prices. We, therefore, could see more M&A activity down the line.",P
Saudi Arabia And The UAE Wont Be Tapping Emergency Oil Capacity.html,"Saudi Arabia and the UAE have the capacity to produce more crude oil, but they won't tap that capacity—at least not yet, according to three anonymous Reuters sources. The message is a critical one for the OPEC producers to get across to the market, which cannot be seen as losing its control over the market—control that comes only from having the spare capacity to affect the market should the need arise. According to the sources, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are ready to deliver a ""significant increase"" in crude oil production if the market should run up against a severe supply crisis this winter. The sources said that this spare capacity would only be tapped in the event of a supply crisis.
 ""With possibly no gas in Europe this winter, with a potential price cap on Russian oil sales in the New Year, we can't be throwing every barrel on the market at the moment,"" one of the Reuters sources said, ""The only time we can prove we have more spare capacity is when it comes to a long-lasting crisis."" The sources said that combined, OPEC members have between 2 million bpd and 2.7 million bpd in spare production capacity. Nevertheless, OPEC+--and OPEC—has failed to meet the current production targets laid out by the OPEC+ agreement agreed to two years ago. The most recent data suggests that the group's compliance rate with its production cuts is 320%, producing more than 2.5 million bpd under target.
 Despite the group's under production, global oil prices have eased in the recent week. Saudi Arabia, however, raised its official selling price for most of its crude grades to most markets—including Asia.",P
Saudi Arabia Lifts Crude Prices To Asia To Record High.html,"OPEC’s most prolific oil producer and exporter, Saudi Arabia, has raised the official selling price of its crude oil to new highs for September loadings. Saudi Arabia raised the price of all of its crude grades to its prized market, Asia, for September. Saudi Arabia raised the September price of Arab Light to the Far East by $0.50 per barrel to $9.80 over the Oman/Dubai benchmark.    OPEC’s largest producer, Saudi Arabia, typically adjusts the selling price of its crude oil a day after the monthly OPEC+ meeting. On Wednesday, the group met to discuss September production plans, ultimately deciding to raise the September quota by 100,000 bpd—26,000 bpd of which was allocated to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia also raised the price of crude oil heading to the United States, North West Europe, and the Mediterranean. Other OPEC producers often reset their prices too, following Saudi’s pricing action. It is also largely seen as a bellwether for how Saudi Arabia views future oil demand. The pricing adjustment paints a more complete picture of the direction the market could be headed. Yesterday, OPEC raised its production quota, indicating that there was an increased need for production beyond its August target (which was already 648,000 bpd over July’s—a move that typically signals that the group sees a greater call on OPEC oil. But today, Saudi Arabia is sending a message to the market that is a bit different; it wants to cool the demand for its exports by hiking prices. This is typically a signal to the market that the Kingdom sees no need for additional production.
 Saudi Arabia did make a few downward adjustments with its Extra Light grades to North West Europe and the Mediterranean.",P
Commodities Trading The Secret Behind Big Oils Bumper Earnings.html,"Dozens of giant commodity and energy traders saw their profits explode during the pandemic thanks to their ability to leverage their storage facilities, global network of terminals and shipping fleets to cash in on supply disruptions, soaring energy prices and rising demand.  Vitol Group, the world’s largest commodity trader, generated record net income of $4.2 billion last year, with rival Mercuria raking in $1.25bn. Vitol announced a major share buy back to the tune of US$3 billion as a way of rewarding the roughly 450 senior staff who own the company. Glencore Plc also enjoyed record numbers, as did Trafigura’s trading arm. Smaller trading desks that lack the wherewithal and deep infrastructure networks of the giants were, unfortunately, unable to take advantage of one of the most volatile--and profitable--periods in the global energy industry. But energy commodities trading is by no means the sole preserve of independent trading desks. Scores of Big Oil companies have set up secretive and sprawling trading divisions which frequently add billions of dollars to their bottom-lines.  Source: Financial Times BP’s Trading Genius
 Whereas several U.S. oil companies have tried their hand in oil trading, it’s European oil and gas supermajors that seem to have perfected the art and science of leveraging volatile oil markets to reap big profits. To wit, last year, Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) famously ditched its effort to build an energy trading business to compete with those of European oil majors after a period of low oil prices forced the company to heavily cut the unit’s funding amid broader spending cuts. The cuts left Exxon traders without sufficient capital to take full advantage of the volatile oil market. The coronavirus pandemic sent oil and gas prices crashing, before a strong rebound created an immense profit opportunity for trading operations willing to take on the risk. Unfortunately, cash flow problems and pressure from investors forced Exxon to systematically avoid risk by pulling most of the capital needed for speculative trades, limiting its traders to working only with longtime Exxon customers and subjecting most trades to high-level management review.  Related: German Chancellor: Germany Could Keep Nuclear Power Plants Operating After All BP Plc. (NYSE: BP), on the other hand, has managed to build one of the most successful energy trading ventures by an oil and gas major. In its latest earnings call, the European supermajor reported that its underlying replacement cost profit--a metric similar to the net income figure commonly used by U.S. oil companies--climbed to $8.45 billion in the second quarter from $6.25 billion in the first quarter, reflecting strong refining margins, higher liquids realizations and exceptional oil trading performance. That figure was well above Wall Street’s expectations of $6.79 billion.  ""The main driver of the large beat was another exceptional quarter of oil products trading,"" RBC Capital Markets said in a note.
 But those record profits were by no means a fluke. BP’s trading desk has been astute at taking advantage of highly volatile energy markets in the past, with former CEO Bob Dudley and his army of 3,000 traders displaying an uncanny ability to predict the oil price trajectory. For instance, Dudley famously told the media that “Prices will remain low for longer,” after oil prices plunged to their lowest in more than a decade in Jan. 2016. This time, though, his well-known mantra came with a kicker: “But not forever.” Few grasped the special significance of Dudley’s comment. In essence, BP traders had turned bullish after months of slumping oil prices. BP’s trading arm argued that the price had fallen so far that it could only go up, and Dudley agreed. And, in complete secrecy, the company was willing to bet that its traders were right again and put its money where its mouth was. Indeed, Dudley authorized a daring trade that saw BP place a large bet on a rebound in oil prices. BP was already heavily exposed to (low) oil prices, yet it chose to double down in a bid to increase the exposure by buying futures contracts much as a hedge fund would. This wager, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, remained a closely guarded secret for years and was only divulged by Bloomberg in 2021.  BP quietly bought Brent crude futures London on a “management position’’--a trade so large it had to be overseen by the company’s most senior executives. And, the gamble paid off. By early February, oil prices were up a third, trading above $35 a barrel. By the end of May, oil prices hit $50 a barrel. A former BP executive with direct knowledge of the trade told Bloomberg that it “made a lot of money,” putting the payout at $150 million to $200 million. Publicly, however, BP said almost nothing. BP’s rivals Shell Plc (NYSE: SHEL) and TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) are also some of the world’s largest commodity traders. Shell is actually the world’s largest oil trader, ahead of independent houses such as Vitol Group and Trafigura. Massive trading floors that sometimes rival Wall Street’s biggest banks are becoming increasingly important to oil companies thanks to fears that global oil demand will soon fall off due to the global energy transition as well as concerns about climate change. However, much about the oil majors’ trading exploits go unreported, just like BP’s 2016 trade. But few shareholders would object: BP typically records from $2 billion to $3 billion annually from its trading desk, roughly equal to what the company’s upstream business generates in a normal year; Shell makes as much as $4 billion in pretax profit from trading oil and gas while French major Total is not far off.",Neutral
OPEC To Boost Production Target By 100000 Bpd In September.html,"The OPEC+ group gave the go-ahead to lift their oil production targets for September by 100,000 bpd as recommended by the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) which met earlier today, Amena Bakr, Chief Opec Correspondent & Deputy Bureau Chief at Energy Intelligence, reported just as the ministerial meeting of OPEC+ began on Wednesday. Today's OPEC+ meeting is the first meeting since the group decided to roll back by the end of August all the cuts from May 2020, when the current agreement started. Analysts had expected the alliance to endorse either flat targets for September compared to August, or a slight increase.
 Ahead of the meeting on Wednesday, the U.S. Department of the State approved on Tuesday a possible Foreign Military Sale to Saudi Arabia—OPEC's top producer—of PATRIOT MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-Tactical Ballistic Missiles (GEM-T) and related equipment for an estimated cost of $3.05 billion. The State Department also cleared a possible Foreign Military Sale to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for an estimated cost of $2.245 billion. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are believed to be the only two producers in OPEC+ and in the world currently holding enough spare capacity to raise their oil production. A 100,000 bpd increase for the entire group will likely mean less than a 30,000 bpd increase for Saudi Arabia, and a less than 10,000 bpd increase for the UAE. Earlier this week, a Fox Business correspondent reported that Saudi Arabia was planning to advocate for higher oil production at Wednesday's OPEC+ meeting. Fox Business' White House correspondent Edward Lawrence cited an unnamed source as saying that Saudi Arabia's King Salman had made the assurance to U.S. President Joe Biden during their meeting in the Kingdom on July 16.
 Higher oil production was one of the reasons for President Biden's visit to the Kingdom last month, although the White House refrained from stating it openly. Oil prices jumped after the announcement.",Neutral
Saudi Arabia May Push For Higher OPEC Production.html,"Saudi Arabia is reportedly planning to advocate for higher oil production at the next OPEC+ meeting, which is taking place later this week. This is according to a tweet by Fox Business' White House correspondent Edward Lawrence, who cited an unnamed source as saying that Saudi Arabia's King Salman had made the assurance to President Biden during their meeting on July 16. Higher oil production was one of the reasons for President Biden's visit to the Kingdom last month, although the White House refrained from stating it openly.
 Hopes among observers were weak, and indeed the President's visit ended without any major announcements regarding the world's oil supply. Soon after the visit, however, Crown Prince Mohammed, son of Salman and the de facto ruler of OPEC's biggest producer, talked about spare capacity, saying the maximum Saudi Arabia could do was 13 million bpd. ""The kingdom has announced an increase in its production capacity level to 13 million barrels per day, after which the kingdom will not have any additional capacity to increase production,"" Mohammed said during the U.S.-Saudi summit where he met with Biden.
 Meanwhile, other reports have it that OPEC+ plans to leave September oil production flat compared to August. A recent Reuters survey showed that OPEC had increased its production by 310,000 bpd in July, is about half of what OPEC+ said it would deliver in July and August to help rebalance oil markets. In June, the OPEC+ Joint Ministerial Committee recommended that the monthly production boost was increased from about 420,000 bpd to 648,000 bpd in the following two months. OPEC+ is meeting tomorrow in Vienna to discuss crude oil production in the month ahead.",Neutral
How Russian Oil Is Making Its Way From Europe To Asia.html,"Russia has been ramping up oil exports to Asia since its invasion of Ukraine led to Western sanctions on imports of Russian oil. Some of the crude and products going to Asia are being transferred from one vessel to another in international waters around Europe, including outside UK territorial waters.  Off the coast of Suffolk in the UK, outside UK territorial waters, at least two ship-to-ship transfers took place in May, and UK-crewed boats helped the transfer and delivered supplies to the tankers, according to an investigation by Global Witness and The Independent.   The coast off Southwold, Suffolk, is designated an area of outstanding natural beauty, but it is also one of the few areas around the UK where ship-to-ship transfers are allowed, The Independent’s Ben Chapman notes.  The STS transfers of fuel oil off Suffolk identified by Global Witness and The Independent saw two tankers carrying 165,000 tons of Russian fuel oil worth over $201 million (£165 million) proceed to the Middle East and Singapore. These oil transfers are not illegal. Yet, such ship-to-ship (STS) transfers around Europe are being increasingly used for reloading Russian oil onto ships that then head to Asia via the Suez Canal, tanker-tracking publications have shown. There are other areas around Europe where STS transfers are happening, and new STS transfer “hubs” have started to emerge in recent months.  According to vessel tracking and analysis by Lloyd’s List, China-owned supertankers are at the center of a new STS transfer hub in the middle of the North Atlantic, around 860 nautical miles west of Portugal. Such operations in the area have never been seen before, Alex Glykas from maritime advisors Dynamarine told Lloyd’s List. 
 Russia is also redirecting its residual fuel oil (RFO) exports – the world’s largest such exports – away from the West and to Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, according to Roslan Khasawneh, a senior fuel oil analyst at the energy analytics firm Vortexa.  “Russia’s changing flows are establishing new transhipments hubs for Russian RFO including offshore Kalamata, Greece where there has been a spike in ship-to-ship transfers as well as in Egypt which has seen its imports of Russian fuel oil climb to a record 70kbd in June. As a result, Egypt’s fuel oil exports jumped to a 10-month high of 120kbd in June, mostly to Saudi Arabia,” Khasawneh wrote in an analysis in July.   Increased STS transfers help Russia move more and more of its oil volumes to Asia and its key buyers there, China and India. These moves are offsetting to a large extent the Western sanctions on Russia’s oil and the effect of the upcoming EU embargo on imports of seaborne Russian oil and products, expected to take effect at the end of the year.  Western sanctions have so far failed to crush Russia’s oil exports as Moscow is redirecting crude and products to its more than willing Asian buyers, China and India.   Related: Oil Dips Amid Renewed Demand Concerns
 Russian oil exports dropped by just 250,000 bpd in June, to 7.4 million bpd, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its monthly report for July. Despite volumes of crude and product exports being at the lowest since August 2021, Russia’s export revenues increased by $700 million month-over-month on higher oil prices, to $20.4 billion, or 40% above last year’s average, the IEA’s estimates showed.  European vessel owners, especially private Greek operators, are moving a lot of the Russian oil in the months before the EU ban on seaborne Russian oil imports kicks in. Greek tanker owners have increased their exposure to Russian oil shipping in the past months as they race to profit from the higher demand for heavily discounted Russian oil in China and India.  Russian exports of crude and products are yet to see a significant dent. Despite slightly lower volumes, so far, Putin is generating more money from oil than he did prior to the invasion of Ukraine or last year, as oil prices stay elevated.  The West’s main goal to cripple Putin’s revenue but still allow Russian oil exports somewhere in the world has led to the idea of capping the price of Russian oil. The G7 group of leading industrialized nations, led by the United States, is considering waiving the ban on insurance and all services enabling transportation of Russian oil if that oil is bought at or below a certain price.  ",Neutral
Oil Dips Amid Renewed Demand Concerns.html,"Oil prices plunged by 4% at the start of August as the market digested weak economic figures from China, the world’s largest crude oil importer. As of 10:12 a.m. ET on Monday, WTI Crude prices were down by 4.49% at $94.22. WTI Crude started August on the decline, following the first back-to-back monthly losses in June and July since the end of 2020. Brent Crude, the international benchmark, was down to $100—after finishing July at the $103 a barrel handle, following a brief intra-day spike to $110 on Friday. Brent Crude traded down by 3.37% to $100.40 at 10:12 a.m. ET on Monday.   The market sentiment at the start of this month was one of concern about the pace of global oil demand after Chinese factory activity unexpectedly contracted, and its manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) improved only marginally in July and was well below expectations.
 PMI readings were also weaker in July than in June in the major Eurozone countries and in South Korea. In China, COVID flare-ups in July led to an unexpected contraction in factory activity, according to data from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics. Per the Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI, the rate of improvement in China’s business conditions eased in July from a 13-month high in June and was only marginal.  
 Weak economic data from China rekindled fears about an economic slowdown in major economies and importers of crude, which could weigh on oil demand going forward. Later this week, traders and market analysts will be watching the OPEC+ monthly meeting on August 3, the first after the group decided to have all the 2020 cuts rolled back by the end of this month. “After gains last week, the focus in crude oil is shifting to the OPEC+ meeting this week where expectations for any notable increase in output for September are minimal. Supply side issues also continue to underpin but focus short-term has shifted to China’s manufacturing PMI miss and the resulting demand contraction,” Saxo Bank said on Monday.",Neutral
US Crude Production Sinks In May.html,"U.S. field production of crude oil fell in May to an average of 11.595 million barrels per day (bpd), new data from the Energy Information Administration showed on Friday. That figure is down from 11.652 million bpd in April—a 57,000 bpd decline. May’s production figures are just 239,000 bpd above where they were at the same time last year, and 1.247 million bpd below pre-Covid levels. U.S. crude oil production fell in May in PADDs 1 and 3, and rose in PADDs 2, 4, and 5. The largest state gain by far was in North Dakota, which saw its production increase from 895,000 bpd to 1.049 million bpd in May. Texas, meanwhile, saw drops in production from 5.017 million bpd to 4.965 million bpd—a level that is even under those seen in December of last year, showing no production growth in Texas at all across those five months.
 New Mexico’s production dropped in May too, from 1.508 million bpd to 1.497 million bpd. The figures vary significantly from what the EIA had originally estimated for May. The EIA had previously estimated that U.S. crude production in May would rise to 11.74 million bpd. The Energy Information Administration estimated in its latest Short Term Energy Outlook that U.S. crude would average 11.91 million bpd this year, and 12.77 million bpd next year—a figure that if realized, would set a new record for U.S. production. 
 For June, the EIA estimated that production had risen to average 11.89 million bpd. With U.S. crude oil inventories down 6% from the five-year average, even with roughly a million barrels per day coming out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the news that U.S. production faltered in May and has failed to make any significant gains since last year contributed to Friday’s price increase, with WTI exceeding $100 per barrel, up more than 4% on the day.",Neutral
Demand Destruction Could Help America Refill Its Oil Inventories.html,"U.S. petroleum inventories are still sitting at multi-year lows for this time of the year despite record releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), reports of weakening gasoline demand over the past weeks because of high prices, and a slowing economy.   Commercial crude and product stockpiles have failed to rebuild over the last few months, and the low levels point to continued tight markets for gasoline and diesel in the short term, potentially supportive of oil prices.   Yet, emphasis has been placed on a fall in U.S. gasoline demand in recent weeks after the national average price hit a record $5 a gallon in the middle of June. This, combined with fears of a recession, have weighed on WTI Crude prices. The U.S. benchmark hit this week its widest discount in over three years compared to the international Brent Crude benchmark.  This faltering demand for gasoline has weighed on WTI, while Brent prices reflect tight global physical supplies, buoyed by Russia's war on Ukraine and Western sanctions, as well as the European Union ban on Russian oil set to be implemented before the end of this year. The biggest discount of WTI to Brent in three years is driving a surge in U.S. crude oil exports, which hit a record high of 4.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the reporting week to July 22.  The most recent data, however, shows that gasoline demand destruction isn't as clear-cut as it initially looked, with the four-week average gasoline demand still trending upward, according to EIA data. Despite signs of downward price pressures on WTI Crude, the lowest U.S. petroleum inventories in years—for some products in decades—are one strong bullish factor for oil prices, although it's not a given that it could outweigh market fears of recession.  In the latest reporting week to July 22, commercial crude oil inventories declined by 4.5 million barrels, the EIA data showed. At 422.1 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are about 6% below the average for this time of the year. In gasoline, inventories decreased by 3.3 million barrels last week and are about 4% below the five-year average for this time of the year. Distillates, which include diesel, have been the tightest market this year, with current stockpile levels 23% below the seasonal five-year average. 
 Distillate fuel oil inventories, which are most closely related to the economic cycle, are at the lowest for the time of year since 2000, according to data compiled by Reuters market analyst John Kemp. So far in the third quarter, distillate stockpiles have risen by less than 1 million barrels, an unusually low pace of inventory builds. This is one of the tiniest distillate inventory builds of the past four decades, Kemp notes.   Related: The Biggest Drivers In Global Steel Supply An economic slowdown could help rebalance those very low levels of distillate stocks, but the rebalance could need a deeper and longer downturn in activity, Kemp argues.  Indeed, the U.S. economy is slowing down. The advance estimate from the U.S. Department of Commerce showed on Thursday that GDP contracted by 0.9% in the second quarter, following a 1.6% decline in Q1. In theory, the GDP data met one common definition of a recession—two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction. But policymakers insist the 'technical' recession is not a broad-based recession because many areas in the economy are still going strong, especially the labor market, and external conditions pushing inflation higher are unique.  ""When you're creating almost 400,000 jobs a month, that is not a recession,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on NBC's Meet the Press last weekend, a few days before the GDP data was released. 
 Policymakers admit there is a slowdown, but the U.S. economy doesn't present broad-based signs of a recession.  ""I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession. And the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference this week after the Fed announced another 75-basis-point hike in key interest rates.  ""Really the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5 and a half percent. We would have expected growth to slow. There's also more slowing going on now,"" Powell said, reiterating the Fed's goal of a ""soft landing.""  ""If you think about what a recession really is, it's a broad-based decline across many industries that sustain for more than a couple of months and there are a bunch of specific tests in it. And this just doesn't seem like that,"" the Fed Chair added.   ",Neutral
NOCs Not Big Oil Are Responsible For Most Emissions.html,stock,Neutral
More Oil Discoveries Boost Guyanas Offshore Boom.html,"The former British colony of Guyana, a nation whose economy was hit hard by the pandemic, has emerged as the world’s hottest offshore drilling location. Since 2015 global energy major ExxonMobil as well as its partners Hess Corporation and CNOOC have made a slew of quality oil discoveries in the offshore Stabroek Block which have delivered resources in excess of 11 billion barrels of oil. This is driving a massive economic boom for Guyana, which was among the poorest nations in Lain America and the Caribbean. According to the IMF, the micro-state’s gross domestic product grew by just under 20% during 2021 and is poised for further strong expansion. The substantial surge in oil prices which sees the international Brent benchmark up by 58% over the last year to be trading for $110 per barrel coupled with the push by big oil to decarbonize its operations are adding considerable momentum to the boom. Guyana’s government is expected to bank over $1 billion in oil revenues during 2022 which according to industry consultancy Rystad Energy will soar to $7.5 billion by the end of the decade. That will deliver a tremendous economic boom which will see Guyana’s economy grow fivefold over that period. Key to this tremendous economic opportunity is the rapid ramping up of crude oil production, with Exxon estimating that its operations will have the capacity to pump 1.2 million barrels per day by 2027, which is further oil discoveries. Exxon and its partners in the 6.6-million-acre Stabroek Block have made over 25 quality discoveries with the crude found being light and sweet with an API of 32 degrees and 0.58% sulfur content. The latest discoveries were at the Seabob and Kiru-Kiru wells in the Stabroek Block to the southeast of the Payara Project. Exxon also announced that production from the Liza oilfield in the Stabroek Block has exceeded the 340,000 barrels per day initially targeted. Earlier this month it was revealed that Exxon had lodged an application with Guyana’s Environmental Protection Agency to drill 35 exploration and appraisal wells in the Stabroek Block. When the energy supermajor’s exploration success in the block is considered along with the five discoveries made in the Stabroek Block earlier this year, the drilling campaign will make additional discoveries boosting the 11 billion barrels already discovered. That crude oil is also economic to extract. Breakeven prices range from $35 per barrel Brent for Liza Phase 1, $25 a barrel for Liza Phase 2, which recently came online, and $32 per barrel for the 220,000-barrel capacity Payara Project, which is scheduled to start production during 2024.   
 While it is the Exxon-led consortium that is key to driving Guyana’s epic oil boom, which will see the Caribbean country become a leading oil producer, other international energy companies are also engaged in exploration drilling. British driller Tullow Oil, which is the operator of the world-class Jubilee field in offshore Guyana discovered in 2007, announced 37.5% partner Repsol, with TotalEnergies holding the remaining 25%, had spud the Beebei-Potaro well in the Kanuku Block. That wildcat well, which comes on the back of the 2020 Carapa medium oil discovery in the block where 13 feet of net oil pay was identified, is targeting a prospect that Repsol estimates contain around 200 million barrels of crude oil. The Kanuku Block lies below the southeastern tip of the Stabroek Block, where Exxon has made nearly all discoveries in offshore Guyana and is believed to lie on the same petroleum fairway. To the east of the Kanuku Block lies Block 58 offshore Suriname, where TotalEnergies and partner Apache have made five quality light oil discoveries with modelling estimating the block contains 6.5 billion barrels. Those factors, notably the slew of high-quality oil discoveries made by Exxon in the Southeastern tip of the Stabroek Block, bode well for further finds by Repsol and its partners in the Kanuku Block.  Related: U.S. Refiners Haven't Seen Fuel Demand Destruction
 Most of the crude oil found so far, in offshore Guyana, has been medium to light and relatively sweet, meaning it is cheaper and easier to refine into high-quality low contaminant fuels such as gasoline and diesel. That means, particularly in comparison to neighboring Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador which all predominantly pump heavy sour crude oil grades, the petroleum being produced in Guyana has a low carbon footprint. Those characteristics are especially important in a world where there are significant global efforts to significantly reduce carbon emissions while ratcheting up pollution restrictions and regulations. Disappointingly for Tullow, its exploration wells in the Orinduik Block, Jethro-1 and Joe-1, found high-sulfur content heavy crude oil, which compared to the light sweet crude being pumped by Exxon from the Stabroek Block is less economically viable. Guyana is a rapidly growing offshore drilling hotspot, accounting for nearly a fifth of discovered oil and natural gas resources globally and nearly a third of solely oil discoveries. The latest discoveries, made by Exxon and Repsol, coupled with growing light oil production will see Guyana become the third largest oil producer in Latin America after Brazil and then Mexico. That will deliver a tremendous economic windfall for the deeply impoverished South American nation which will grow with Georgetown focused on attracting greater energy investment and building urgently needed industry infrastructure.",Neutral
